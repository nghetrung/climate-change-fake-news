{"dev-0": {"text": "Are Climate Models Overpredicting Global Warming?\nMany recent climate models have been predicting dire global changes. The problem is climate forecasters currently ignore decades of scientific best\u2010\u200bpractices that would offer more accurate predictions.\nThankfully, there are attempts to rectify the truly dodgy methodology that has been used to crank out forecasts of 21st\u2010\u200bcentury climate.\nAn important new climate\u00a0paper published in\u00a0Nature Climate\u00a0Change, written by Viktoria Eyring of the University of Bremen and 28 co\u2010\u200bauthors from around the world, does just that.\nThat\u2019s sorely needed. Here\u2019s why:\u00a0\nWeather forecasters know that some models work better than others in specific situations, and they tend to rely on the versions that work best, depending upon the forecast problem. When the issue is a\u00a0potential big snow along the eastern seaboard, forecasters usually lean upon the model from the European Center for Medium\u2010\u200bRange Weather Forecasting (the \u201cEuro\u201d model). When diagnosing shifts in jet stream patterns a\u00a0week or 10\u00a0days ahead, they may place more weight on the American Global Forecast System model.\nBut the United Nations\u2019 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change simply averages up the 29 major climate models to come up with the forecast for warming in the 21st century, a\u00a0practice rarely done in operational weather forecasting. As dryly noted by Eyring and others\u00a0\u201cthere is now evidence that giving equal weight to each available model projection is suboptimal.\u201d\nIndeed. The authors of the new paper show that the aggregate models are making huge errors in three of the places on earth that are critical to our understanding of climate.\u00a0\nThe first big error is over the entire Southern Ocean, the huge circumpolar body of water separating South America, Africa and Australia from Antarctica. The 29 models calculate, on average, it to be much less cold than it actually is, with large swaths 2.7 degree Fahrenheit or more warmer than reality. Given that the southern margin of the Southern Ocean is mostly sea\u2010\u200bice, this means that vast areas of real\u2010\u200bworld ice are simulated as being liquid water.\nFurther, almost all of the moisture that precipitates over Antarctica comes from the Southern Ocean, and an enormous amount of additional water vapor in forecasts comes from the practice of using models that raise the ocean temperature a\u00a0few degrees beyond what it actually is. The result is a\u00a0forecast of gobs of nonexistent snow originating from an ocean with swaths of nonexistent open water.\u00a0\nAnother important error is along the west coast of South America. In the real world, thanks to the steady pull of the trade winds diverging water away from the coast, cold subsurface water wells up. When, for largely unknown reasons, the trade winds temporarily weaken, the surface water temperature rises dramatically, inducing an\u00a0El Ni\u00f1o\u00a0that may cause floods thousands of miles away in Southern California.\nIn a\u00a0world experiencing a\u00a0modest warming trend, El Nintilde;o usually yields record warm temperatures. The model also greatly underestimates a\u00a0similar area of upwelling off of the African coast that induces the tropical Atlantic\u2019s version of El Nintilde;o,\u00a0known as the\u00a0Atlantic Ni\u00f1o.\nThere\u2019s a\u00a0current theory that some of the heat from each El Nintilde;o is retained in the atmosphere, and temperatures do not return to their previous value once an El Nintilde;o goes away. As a\u00a0result, surface temperatures appear to jump with each big one. Climate models that substantially underestimate the natural cold upwelling have a\u00a0propensity to create El Nintilde;o\u2011like conditions, which may explain their tendency to predict too much global warming.\nBut one of the models actually works. According to University of Alabama\u2019s John Christy and his colleagues, only the Russian model, designated INM-CM4, gets things right. So why not weight heavily on the model that is working? Perhaps because it has less global warming in it than all the other U.N. models?\nIts successor,\u00a0INM-CM5, is so good that it is the only one that diagnoses the \u201cpause\u201d in warming from 2002 to 2014. That the \u201cpause\u201d was real is obvious\u00a0in the global\u00a0surface temperature record\u00a0that the that the IPCC relies upon most heavily,\u00a0from the Climate Research Unit at the University of East Anglia.\nIt\u2019s high time that the scientific community come clean about longstanding climate shenanigans. Averaging up a\u00a0large number of models that don\u2019t work well is guaranteed to produce an unreliable forecast. Using ones that get things right, like the two Russian models, is accepted best\u2010\u200bpractice in weather forecasting. With regard to forecasting methodology, new research at least moves climate science closer to the 20th century.", "label": 1}, "dev-1": {"text": "The latest National Climate Assessment, released just last week, aims to plant yet another seed of climate catastrophism into the mind of the public. Predictably, its worst-case scenarios got huge play in the media. After all, disaster sells.\n\nBut the doomsday scenarios that animated talking heads throughout the weekend aren\u2019t just highly unlikely; they\u2019re close to impossible. For example, the report speculated that climate \u201cinaction\u201d could result in as much as a 10 percent drop in U.S. gross domestic product by 2100. Admittedly, a lot can happen in 82 years. But a 10 percent drop in GDP is more than twice the loss suffered during the Great Recession.\n\nHow could things get so bad? Well, put garbage in, and you\u2019ll get garbage out. The study, funded in part by climate warrior Tom Steyer, calculates these costs by assuming that the world will be 15 degrees Fahrenheit warmer by 2100. That mind-boggling assumption is even higher than the worst-case scenario predicted by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. In other words, it is completely unrealistic.\nOther scary projections in the National Climate Assessment rely on a theoretical climate trajectory known as Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 (RCP 8.5) \u2014 one of four trajectories that climatologists use to estimate the effects of different greenhouse-gas concentrations.\n\nTo put it plainly, RCP 8.5 assumes a combination of extreme factors \u2014 all bad \u2014 that are not likely to all coincide. It assumes \u201cthe fastest population growth (a doubling of Earth\u2019s population to 12 billion), the lowest rate of technology development, slow GDP growth, a massive increase in world poverty, plus high energy use and emissions.\u201d\n\nThis extraordinary scenario assumes a massive increase in coal consumption \u2014 completely ignoring the dramatic increase in natural-gas production from the shale revolution. It also ignores technological innovations that continue to occur in nuclear and renewable technologies.\n\nWhen taking a more realistic view of the future of conventional fuel use and increased greenhouse-gas emissions, the doomsday scenarios vanish. Climatologist Judith Curry recently wrote, \u201cMany \u2018catastrophic\u2019 impacts of climate change don\u2019t really kick at the lower CO2 concentrations, and RCP 8.5 then becomes useful as a \u2018scare\u2019 tactic.\u201d\n\nThe National Climate Assessment insists that climate change is already taking a heavy toll, and things will only get worse. Global warming has worsened heat waves and wildfires, it claims. And we\u2019ll be seeing more hurricanes and floods, too.\n\nBut last year\u2019s National Climate Assessment on extreme weather tells a different story. As University of Colorado Boulder professor Roger Pielke Jr. pointed out in a Twitter thread in August 2017, there were no increases in drought, no increases in frequency or magnitude of floods, no trends in frequency or intensity of hurricanes, and \u201clow confidence for a detectable human climate change contribution in the Western United States based on existing studies.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s hard to imagine all of that could be flipped on its head in a matter of a year.\n\nThis year\u2019s report stresses that it \u201cwas created to inform policy-makers and makes no specific recommendations on how to remedy the problem.\u201d Yet the takeaway was clear: The cost of inaction is bound to dwarf the cost of any carbon-reduction proposal out there.\n\nThe reality, however, is that all of the currently favored proposals for combatting climate change carry significant costs and (here\u2019s the even more important part) would do nothing to mitigate warming, even if there were a looming catastrophe like the National Climate Assessment imagines.\n\nJust last month, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change proposed a carbon tax of between $135 and $5,500 by the year 2030. An energy tax of that magnitude would bankrupt families and businesses and undoubtedly catapult the world into economic despair.\n\nThese policies would simply divert resources away from more valuable use, such as investing in more robust infrastructure to protect against natural disasters or investing in new technologies that make Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 even more of an afterthought than it already should be.\n\nIt\u2019s human nature to ponder what-ifs and worse-case scenarios. Every time I board a flight, I think about the plane going down. But I know the statistical likelihood of that happening is near nil. And I certainly don\u2019t go around spreading misinformation about how unsafe planes are.\n\nClimate alarmists, however, see things differently. They want the world to share their concerns and seem willing to say \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to get people on board. But propagating improbabilities isn\u2019t science. It\u2019s irresponsible and does a disservice to the climate discussion broadly.", "label": 1}, "dev-2": {"text": "Climate Strike Kids Cool on Real Action\nA popular rebuttal to the Klimate Kiddies is that they should walk the walk, give up their power-gobbling devices and stop riding mummy and daddy\u2019s gas-guzzling 4WD to school. Another way these shrieking ninnies could put their money where their mouths are is to give up air-conditioning.\nThat\u2019s not about to happen. In fact, quite the opposite.\nMore than 1300 schools have put their hands up for airconditioning under the Cooler Classrooms program, but almost a year after the first round of recipients was announced, just 27 have so far received it.\nWork has begun at another 23 schools under the five-year, $500 million project, according to figures from the NSW Department of Education. But the NSW opposition argued that at this rate, the airconditioning rollout would take decades.\nSo, while we are seeing another example of government efficiency on a par with Kiwibuild, the real story is that schools \u2013 which last week were striking to protest climate change \u2013 are nonetheless clamouring for air-conditioning.\nIt\u2019s almost like they don\u2019t really care about climate change at all!\nBut, with the sort of logic we\u2019ve come to expect from climate activists, they\u2019re claiming they need all that planet-killing air-con because of climate change. They have to kill the planet in order to live with it.\nThe figures came as a climate expert warned the department was in a race against time to deliver airconditioning, with temperatures across Sydney increasing and each extra degree of heat reducing learning capacity by two per cent.\nWell, they could always trade-off against that by ditching all the PC garbage about transgenderism and climate change that they\u2019re clogging children\u2019s minds with. Ditch the watermelon rubbish and net learning capacity would soar, even in a heatwave.\nBesides, do they want to save the planet, or not?\nThis isn\u2019t just old-fart snarking, either. It\u2019s a fundamental principle. Either these foolish children (and that\u2019s just the teachers) believe the garbage they\u2019re shrieking at us, or they don\u2019t. If they do believe it \u2013 really, really believe it \u2013 then surely no sacrifice would be too much?

We have to work closely with coal-dependent regions and put in a plan so that everyone gets a good future.\u201d\nSwan will also warn his former parliamentary colleagues to apply \u201clarge doses of healthy scepticism about the hand-on-heart last minute conversion of the Business Council of Australia to the cause\u201d. The BCA criticised Labor policy at the last federal election, but has recently backed a legislated target of net zero emissions by 2050, which aligns with the policy outlined on February 20 by Anthony Albanese.\nSwan will say Labor is a party that accepts the science of climate change, supports blue-collar jobs, and has sought a way forward to reduce emissions across the economy with \u201cno help from the right or the extreme left\u201d.\n\u201cProposals that talk about shutting down the export coal industry instead of focusing on the hard and tough policy which includes reducing emissions across the whole of our economy are entirely counter-productive,\u201d the ALP president will say.\n\u201cOver the next 20 years there will be a dramatic reduction in coal production delivered by the market, and we will see coal-fired power generation provide less and less of our electricity\u201d.\n\u201cBut the notion put forward by some green groups that we could phase out coal-fired power by 2030 is impossible and a recipe for blackouts and the further erosion of public support for strong economy-wide action on emissions reduction.\u201d\nSwan will argue Morrison does not have a serious climate policy, and will not develop one, \u201cbut as you would expect from a marketing guy, [he has] a clearly articulated PR strategy to use climate as a wedge aimed not just at coal miners but working people more generally and particularly the elderly\u201d.\nHe will say Morrison\u2019s approach will be to argue he is \u201cthe reasonable guy in the middle who says the climate is changing\u201d but do little or nothing about it. \u201cWe in the Labor party need to expose this marketing strategy for what it is.\n\u201cAnd we need to set against it our hard work on what I simply call solving the bloody problem.\u201d\nThe Morrison government has blasted Labor for adopting a 2050 target without a roadmap to get there. On Friday the government signalled plans to shift investment from wind and solar to hydrogen, carbon capture and storage, lithium and advanced livestock feed supplements, as part of a \u201cbottom up\u201d strategy to reduce emissions by 2050.\nThe government will shortly release a technology roadmap outlining its investment strategies, and further policy work is under way. As well as the roadmap, the government is reviewing its much-criticised emissions reduction fund and the operation of the safeguard mechanism, and is working on an electric vehicles strategy, despite blasting Labor during last year\u2019s election, claiming measures to drive the takeup of EVs were a \u201cwar on the weekend\u201d.\nDespite blasting Labor for adopting net zero, the government has not ruled out following suit and adopting a mid-century target.

And, yes, human activity is playing a role. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 5th Assessment attributes at least half of the warming from 1951 to 2010 to human activities.\n\nBut the panel never concluded the world has only 11 years to avoid a climate apocalypse \u2014 a claim least one presidential candidate made during the CNN telethon.\n\nAll the candidates endorsed climate policies that would profoundly affect the U.S. economy. But their questioners never bothered to ask: Just how much warming would that policy avert?\n\nFor instance, nearly every candidate backed a moratorium on fossil fuel production on federal lands. Yet a climate model developed at the National Center for Atmospheric Research suggests that such a ban would ease warming by only 0.08 degrees Celsius by the year 2100. In other words, it would barely move the climate needle.\n\nWhile the proposals embraced on the CNN stage would, in general, have a negligible effect on global temperature, the costs would be enormous. As the New York Times put it, \u201cAll of the candidates want to spend money, and lots of it.\u201d\n\nThe run-up in the national debt would be ruinous, both for the nation\u2019s economy and for the nation\u2019s taxpayers who would have to cover the extravagant public spending for generations. Politicians worried about the future of our children and grandchildren might have second thoughts about saddling them with loads of debt to make no discernible impact on the climate.\n\nAnd policies that prohibit the use of natural resources impose even greater costs \u2014 direct and indirect \u2014 on individuals, families and businesses. Fossil fuels meet about 80% of America\u2019s energy demand for three basic reasons: They\u2019re abundant, reliable and affordable. Policies that artificially restrict their use would result in higher electric bills and higher prices at the pump.\n\nAnd that\u2019s just the start. Businesses would, of necessity, pass much of higher energy costs onto consumers, so you\u2019ll pay more at the grocery store, the mall and going out to eat. They would offset the rest of the costs by scaling down wages and hiring and investing less in new products and technology.\n\nFossil fuels no more?\n\nAnd the fossil fuel energy sector would, of course, be decimated. Growth in that sector was the only thing that kept the 2008 recession from devolving into a full-blown depression, and it remains one of the brightest flames in the American economy today. The command-and-control style energy policies proposed throughout the CNN town hall would snuff out that flame.\n\nNo matter how much the candidates promise to help fossil fuel workers transition or to help families facing higher energy costs, a government-imposed \u201cgreen revolution\u201d would leave those people much worse off.\n\nAnd let\u2019s not forget the costs to individual freedom and consumer choice. The town hall featured a lot of talk about cheeseburgers. And straws. Many of the candidates joked about their love of red meat, while dodging the question of how they would tackle agricultural emissions.\n\nBut the kinds of energy and environmental policies presented on the stage would, without question, severely limit consumer choice in many areas: from the type of energy you should use, to the kind of car or appliance you should buy, how much meat you should eat. It\u2019s one thing when you make these decisions for yourself. It another when Washington forces its decisions on you.\n\nPerhaps the most puzzling moments of the \u201cclimate crisis\u201d town hall came as several candidates flatly ruled out expanding use of the planet\u2019s largest source of emissions-free electricity: nuclear power. If people can\u2019t even contemplate nuclear power in a discussion of climate change, you can pretty much write off the conversation as so much hot air.\n\nDespite its length, CNN\u2019s climate marathon disclosed little new information. While there were differences among the candidates\u2019 plans, what stood out most were the similarities: more government control, more government spending, higher energy prices and no real climate solutions.", "label": 1}, "dev-5": {"text": "Leonardo DiCaprio Teams Up with Greta Thunberg to Stop Climate Change\nWell, knock me over with a feather.

This is filtered through politicians and media, to become: \u201ctemperatures are going to rise by 3 degrees!\u201d Gullible, terrified children amplify that to \u201cWe\u2019re all going to die!\u201d\nIt\u2019s a spectacularly idiotic outbreak of the madness of crowds, fuelled by a steady avalanche of ideologically-amped Chinese whispers.\nIn an influential paper, Weitzman (2009) argued that climate policy should be directed at reducing the risks of worst-case outcomes, not at balancing the most likely values of costs and benefits. Ackerman (2017) has argued that policy should be based on the credible worst-case outcome.\nThis is utter nonsense. There\u2019s a worst-case possibility that Earth could be invaded by hostile aliens at any given time. Would anyone argue seriously that we must therefore, spend everything we can building giant space-laser defences to fend off the alien invasion?\nOf course, the alien invasion scenario is barely credible. But then, so is climate catastrophism.\nThe issue then becomes how to judge what is \u2018credible.\u2019 It has been argued here that a useful criterion for a plausible (credible) worst-case climate outcome is that at most one borderline implausible assumption \u2013 defined as an assumption where experts disagree as to whether or not it is plausible \u2013 is included in developing the scenario.\n[\u2026]The largest rates of warming that are often cited in impact assessment analyses (e.g. 4.5 or 5 oC) rely on climate models being driven by a borderline implausible concentration/emission scenarios\u2026Even the more moderate amount of warming of 3.1oC relies on climate models with values of the equilibrium climate sensitivity that are larger than can be defended based on analysis of historical climate change.\n[\u2026]The most extreme of the published worst-case scenarios require a cascade of events, each of which are extremely unlikely to borderline impossible based on our current knowledge base.\nIn other words, the science is not \u201ccrystal clear\u201d.

More than a billion animals were killed and threatened species were pushed towards extinction. Thousands of homes were destroyed.\nThe 17 scientists from across Europe and the US, used computer climate models to examine the impact of increased levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere on the risk of intense fires.\nThe bushfire study used the computer models to look at a metric called the Fire Weather Index, which is one way to predict the severity of fires by combining wind speed, relative humidity, temperature, drought and the flammability of the fuel. The index is widely used across the world to forecast dangerous wildfire conditions.\nThe models found the probability of the index reaching levels seen during Australia\u2019s bushfires had increased due to human-caused climate change by 30%.\nBut the scientists said the influence of extra greenhouse gases was likely much higher because when they compared the climate models to the actual temperatures, they found the models underestimated the extreme heat seen during the bushfires.\nProf Geert Jan van Oldenborgh, lead author of the study, of the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute, said: \u201cWe found that climate models struggle to reproduce these extreme events and their trends realistically.\n\u201cHowever, they always underestimate the increase in chances for extreme fire risks such as Australia saw in the last few months. This means we know the effect is likely larger than 30% increase lower bound, which is already a significant influence of global warming.\u201d\nThe analysis also looked at conditions under a climate that warms by 2C above the pre-industrial levels. Two climate models found that fire weather conditions like those seen in 2019 \u201cbecome about eight times more likely\u201d in a 2C world, with a \u201clower bound of four times more likely.\u201d\nThe study released on Thursday has not been peer reviewed, but is being submitted to a journal with all data being made available. The methods and climate models had been used in previous studies that had been peer reviewed, they said.\nDr Sophie Lewis, a co-author of the study from the University of New South Wales, told a briefing the fires had broken out during Australia\u2019s hottest and driest year on record.\nShe said new records had been set for high Forest Fire Danger Index in all states and territories throughout the 2019 spring.\nLewis, who is based in Canberra, recalled being stuck in her own home with a young family for weeks to avoid the heavy smoke from the bushfires.\nShe said: \u201cIn January, the national park that forms a large part of our home in Canberra exploded in flames. It was just last week the fire was declared out.\n\u201cClearly this was an event with an enormous ecological and human cost. It\u2019s because of this that it\u2019s so important to understand the contributing factors to this.\u201d\nLooking only at observations, the scientists found the chances of Australia experiencing Fire Weather Index ratings as high as 2019 had already risen by \u201cmore than a factor of four\u201d since 1900.\nThe scientists that analysed the bushfire conditions are part of a project called World Weather Attribution that has examined the human influence on previous extreme events, including the 2016 bleaching of the Great Barrier Reef.\nThat analysis found human-caused climate change had made the heat during the bleaching event 175 times more likely to happen.\nCo-author Maarten van Aalst, director of the Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre in the Netherlands, said it was \u201creally scary that we are seeing such extreme conditions in countries that are as well prepared [for bushfires] as Australia.\u201d\nHe said: \u201cWhat\u2019s really obvious in light of these findings of rising risk is that it will become even more important to build resilience and prepare for these rising risks.\n\u201cBut there are also limits to what we can do through that adaptation and preparedness. So it\u2019s critical that we find ways of reducing the underlying drivers of these rising risks to avoid problems getting even further out of hand in the future.\u201d\nDr Sarah Perkins-Kirkpatrick, a UNSW climate scientist who examines extreme events who was not an author on the study, said: \u201cFire weather is a very complex thing to simulate.\n\u201cCombined with everything about this event being unprecedented, its extremely challenging for climate models to simulate everything about fire weather perfectly.\n\u201cAustralia just just experienced its worst bushfire season on record, overlapping our warmest and driest year on record.

They Should Reject His Climate Agenda.\n\nA year ago this month, the \u201cyellow vest\u201d protests began in France. More than 300,000 men and women took to the streets of Paris, Lyon, and Toulouse dressed in bright yellow safety vests. \n\nThey marched largely in opposition to a proposed fuel tax, arguing that gas prices in France were already too high. A beleaguered President Emmanuel Macron attempted to justify his policy by explaining the tax was necessary to reach goals agreed to in the Paris climate accord. \n\nThe protesters didn\u2019t care. They continued to march until both the proposed tax was defeated and they had Macron in political trouble. \nSince then, the movement that haunted the French president has largely fizzled into obscurity. But on the one-year anniversary of the protests, we have an opportunity to reflect on the policies that the movement strove to implement, and where the yellow vests failed to make a real difference.\n\nIt is important to start with the context surrounding the protests. \n\nIn 2018, French drivers could expect to pay more than $6 per gallon at the pump. These high prices were a direct result of energy taxes used to fund infrastructure work and other government projects.\n\nThe fuel tax that sparked the protests was just another one of these taxes, but the rationale justifying it was new. Macron explicitly said the tax was a direct result of the Paris climate accord. \n\nAs one protestor put it: \u201cFuel is already overtaxed and the increase was absolutely not going to pay for climate. That was money for the government\u2019s pockets, and only a bit for climate.\u201d\n\nYet herein lies the irony. As these protesters slammed the government for rising gas costs, they simultaneously called for increased government intrusion in the name of fighting climate change. \n\nAs one of us explained in a previous piece, the Paris climate accord \u201cwould have been as disastrous for the American economy as it is proving to be for those in Europe. Heritage Foundation analysts projected that this agreement would have raised energy prices, killed jobs, and cost the average family of four $20,000 by 2035.\u201d \n\nBut the myth persists that the accord is the one and only way to save the planet. Interestingly, the anniversary of the yellow vest protests lines up with the United States\u2019 recently announced formal withdrawal from the deal.\n\nWhat the protesters have failed or refused to realize is that their stated goals are fundamentally incompatible with each other. The road to a government scheme to allegedly \u201cfix\u201d the climate is paved with higher taxes.\n\nThis is the crux of the problem. The Paris climate accord is a failure on multiple levels. It fails to please anybody and does far more harm than good.\n\nThe French are uniquely predisposed to bristle at higher fuel taxes because they are already one of the lowest emitters on the Continent. In fact, the data shows that the biggest emitters by far are the Chinese, who account for 27% of total global emissions. \n\nBut the accord fails here, too. The agreement is toothless, with nonexistent enforcement mechanisms and weak incentives for any country to actually try to follow the deal. \n\nDeveloping countries are rightly prioritizing reducing energy poverty and will continue to increase their emissions well into the future. For these countries, the deal is all promises to meet nearly impossible expectations with no real action. \n\nAs the Natural Resources Defense Council, a pro-Paris accord group, states on its website: \u201cNo language is included on the commitments countries should make, nations can voluntarily set their emissions targets, and countries incur no penalties for falling short of their proposed targets.\u201d\n\nThe yellow vest movement had lofty ambitions. The protesters saw an unfair tax being levied against them in the name of climate alarmism and rightly said \u201cenough.\u201d They then faltered because they failed to see the true problem. \n\nThe Paris climate accord will force these higher taxes and more, and for negligible effect on global temperatures. Much like the French government\u2019s fuel tax, the Paris climate accord is a costly non-solution that will leave people worse off and with fewer resources to address environmental challenges.\n\nIf the protesters want competitive energy prices and less government control, they should follow the American example and push to leave the accord. Otherwise, they\u2019ll be marching for many years to come.\n<|endoftext|>", "label": 1}, "dev-10": {"text": "Civilization will end within 15 or 30 years unless immediate action is taken against problems facing mankind.\u201d\n\nSounds dire. A reaction to the National Climate Assessment published the day after Thanksgiving? No. Harvard biologist George Wald made that claim in 1970.\n\nSo if Wald had been correct, just about everything would have crumbled to ruin sometime between 1985 and 2000.\nWald, however, wasn\u2019t alone. He and others came up with some incredibly over-the-top predictions as the 1960s came to a close.\n\n\u201cEarth Day\u201d founder Denis Hayes, for example, didn\u2019t hedge his bets: \u201cIt is already too late to avoid mass starvation.\u201d Or take Paul Ehrlich (please).

Food production spiked in the ensuing years. And starvation on such a massive scale never materialized, thank God.\n\nMany other examples could be cited (I haven\u2019t even touched on predictions by global-warming luminaries such as Al Gore), but I hope the point is clear: Take sky-is-falling claims with a large grain of salt.\n\nParticularly because they never seem to go out of style. You\u2019d think, given the track record I\u2019ve just referred to, that doomsayers would learn to temper their warnings, at least a little bit. But no. We see the same trend at work with the National Climate Assessment.\n\n\u201cGlobal greenhouse gas emissions is expected to cause substantial net damage to the U.S. economy throughout this century,\u201d we read in the 1,700-page report.\n\n\nHow substantial? As The New York Times noted: \u201cAll told, the report says, climate change could slash up to a tenth of gross domestic product by 2100, more than double the losses of the Great Recession a decade ago.\u201d\n\nSounds awful, to put it mildly. Then again, so did the first Earth Day predictions. And these latest claims are just as plausible, according to climate expert Nicolas Loris.\n\n\u201cThe study \u2026 calculates these costs on the assumption that the world will be 15 degrees Fahrenheit warmer,\u201d he writes. \u201cThat temperature projection is even higher than the worst-case scenario predicted by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.\n\u201cIn other words, it is completely unrealistic.\u201d\n\nSo where do these Chicken Little claims come from? In the report, climatologists lay out four possible future trajectories for the environment. Alarmists seized on the worst one.\n\nIt\u2019s also the least likely. It assumes a combination of bad factors will somehow coincide \u2014 that global population will climb at the fastest-possible rate (about double the current amount), that technology will develop at the slowest-possible rate, and that world poverty will increase massively, along with energy use and emissions.\n\nWould it be responsible to assume the best-case scenario? Of course not. But assuming the worst-case is no better. In fact, considering the policy changes that believers wind up pushing as a result \u2013 such as huge carbon taxes and giant subsidies for dubious \u201cgreen\u201d projects \u2014 it\u2019s even less responsible.\n\nNot that the alarmists need an excuse like the National Climate Assessment to make bad recommendations. Even before it came out, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change had proposed a carbon tax of between $135 and $5,500 per ton of carbon emissions by the year 2030.\n\n\u201cAn energy tax of that magnitude would bankrupt families and businesses, and undoubtedly catapult the world into economic despair,\u201d Mr. Loris writes.\nIf the doomsayers want to spread pessimism, that\u2019s their business. But the rest of us shouldn\u2019t have to pay for it.\nIt\u2019s time for the global-warming crowd to realize, once and for all, that civilization isn\u2019t ending \u2013 not in 1985 and not in 2100.

At the root of many of history\u2019s scientific regressions are attempts by powerful people to silence minority opinions.\nSen.

In a\u00a0March 15 letter to editor (\u201c\u00a0\u2018Scientists\u2019 may be engaged in fraud against public\u201d), he dismissed the idea that this undermines scientific freedom.\nHe suggests the Cato Institute\u2019s right to privacy is nefarious and that Cato\u2019s funding, 95 percent of which comes from non\u2010\u200bcorporate donors, has turned me into a\u00a0climate denier. His insinuation is demonstrably false in several ways.\n\nAs a\u00a0climatologist who has researched climate change, its causes, and its impacts for nearly three decades, I\u00a0can say quite confidently I\u00a0don\u2019t \u201cdeny\u201d climate change. In fact, Mr. Whitehouse and I\u00a0probably are in much closer agreement on the climate science than the senator realizes \u2014 or perhaps, cares to admit.\nMr. Whitehouse, who has made a\u00a0name for himself on this issue by delivering weekly speeches on the topic from the Senate floor for the past three years, has said, \u201cThe atmosphere is warming; ice is melting; seas are warming, rising and acidifying.\u201d I\u00a0completely agree with this assessment. I\u00a0also agree human emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouses gases \u2014 largely a\u00a0result of humanity\u2019s quest for accessible energy \u2014 play a\u00a0significant role in these changes. In fact, there is consensus on these views, as Mr. Whitehouse frequently notes.\nThe level of agreement diverges, however, as we go from generalities to specifics. For example, Mr. Whitehouse confidently ascribes changes in frequency and ferocity of extreme weather events to human\u2010\u200bcaused climate changes, while the scientific literature is much more nuanced. The scientific consensus, such as that presented by the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, holds that links between the occurrence of most types of extreme weather events and climate change are neither well\u2010\u200bestablished nor well\u2010\u200bsupported. I\u00a0stand close to the scientific majority on this issue, but apart from Mr. Whitehouse.\nThe biggest difference, however, between Mr. Whitehouse and me \u2014 and likely all the climate scientists whom Mr. Whitehouse decorates with derogatory terms and whom the senator seeks to intimidate \u2014 is in our preferred policy response.\nMr. Whitehouse is very vocal in his support for legislation aimed at severely restricting emissions of carbon dioxide by placing a\u00a0price on carbon. Climate change doesn\u2019t call for strong\u2010\u200bhanded government\u2010\u200bled tactics that may hamper our economy, risk the supply and reliability of our energy production, and dampen the pace of human\u2010\u200bbetterment in developing countries around the world.\nIn fact, according to the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s own models, these types of efforts do nothing to demonstrably improve the climate. For me, free market\u2010\u200bled adaptation to changing climate conditions, regardless of cause, is an approach much more likely to produce manifold and tangible positive outcomes.\nIt is these differences \u2014 in policy, not science \u2014 that are at the heart of Mr. Whitehouse\u2019s investigation. But whereas Mr. Whitehouse has failed to persuade Congress to tax carbon, his one\u2010\u200bsided investigation helps derail scientific advancement, turn off those who would study science as a\u00a0way of improving their society, and decrease already low opinions many hold of our federal legislators.\nWoe be it for a\u00a0climate scientist dependent on federal monies to report results that run contrary to the underpinnings of the administration\u2019s Climate Action Plan. Future funding and career advancement are jeopardized. Consequently, such results don\u2019t find their way into the scientific knowledge base. When this happens repeatedly, science proceeds in the wrong direction and may become misleading, even dangerous. This can happen when scientific funding is monopolized through the federal government. Senator Whitehouse\u2019s investigations are an attempt to further consolidate federal control over climate science by demonizing funding from non\u2010\u200bgovernment sources.\nDespite Mr. Whitehouse\u2019s protestations, scientific freedom is the issue here.

And it really is about recycling \u2014 of old, tired, and discredited ideas. \nMuch of it reads like the disproven doomsday predictions that have been churned out since the early days of the environmental movement. In his 1968 classic, The Population Bomb, Paul Ehrlich wrote that by about 1983 India would be \u201cgone,\u201d hundreds of millions would die in famines (caused in part by global cooling), and there would be human \u201coblivion.\u201d In their 1972 book The Limits to Growth, Dennis and Donella Meadows confidently predicted we would be out of oil, most food, and breathable air by 2000. It is against this historical backdrop that Pope Francis writes that \u201cdoomsday predictions can no longer be met with irony or disdain.\u201d \nMy generation has lived through eight environmental apocalypses, including the two cited above. We have good reasons for disdain. \nSince Ehrlich and Meadows, human ingenuity discovered vast amounts of oil and gas beneath our feet, food production per capita increased smoothly and smartly, and countries with free economies cleaned up their environments. What will happen after Francis\u2019s encyclical? \nPope Francis practices what Mikhail Gorbachev would refer to as \u201cold thinking,\u201d in this case, that free economies can\u2019t solve the \u201cproblems of global hunger and poverty,\u201d and that they somehow destroy their natural resources while being incapable of dealing with climate change. \nWhere does he get this stuff? Since the turn of the 20th century, life expectancy has doubled in the developed world, per capita income has grown elevenfold, and wealth as been democratized far beyond the wildest opium dreams of Karl Marx. This happened in energy\u2010\u200bdriven free market economies, not the command\u2010\u200band\u2010\u200bcontrol world that Francis envisions. Crucially, the developed world brought into existence by overcoming energy poverty is largely immune to the vagaries of weather and climate. Poor countries are not. \nMake no mistake: limiting access to energy will keep people poor and life short. Solar energy and windmills are never going to power a\u00a0major modern city, and therefore they will never run a\u00a0modern nation. With the exception of geographically\u2010\u200blimited hydropower or sometimes unpopular nuclear fusion, the only way to avoid a\u00a0life of poverty, infirmity, and vulnerability to climate is through the use of fossil fuels. They have been the engine of wealth and progress. \nInstead of promoting the access to dense energy that the developing world desperately needs, Francis proposes an international authority to enforce environmental diktats emanating from the United Nations. This includes handing over $100 billion a\u00a0year from developed nations to the underdeveloped to spend on technologies incapable of substantively boosting their quality of life. \nHe asks Catholics to pray for the nations of the world to agree to a\u00a0new climate treaty in Paris next December.

It plans to spend at least \u00a3800m to decarbonise at least two heavy-industry \u201ccarbon clusters\u201d, the first in 2025 and the second by 2030.\nThese schemes could keep millions of tonnes of carbon from contributing to global heating and create 6,000 highly skilled green jobs in industrial areas such as Teesside, Merseyside, the Humber and St Fergus in Scotland.\nThe funding is less than the \u00a31bn demonstration fund axed by the Conservative government in 2015, and falls short of calls from MPs and the CCC to roll out multiple carbon capture projects by 2025.\nThe government also plans to spend \u00a31bn on green transport, including more than \u00a3400m to extend grants for new electric vehicles and \u00a3500m to support the rollout of new rapid charging hubs so that drivers are never more than 30 miles away from being able to charge up their car. It has also maintained a long-held freeze on fuel duty for fossil fuel vehicles.\nJayne Harrold, a leader on environmental tax at PricewaterhouseCoopers, said the Treasury\u2019s green measures offered mixed messages before the UN climate talks in Glasgow in November.\n\u201cOn the one hand we have the freezing of fuel duty and the building of 4,000 miles of new roads and on the other we have incentives for cleaner forms of transport, minor shifts to energy taxes, and significant investment in carbon capture and storage,\u201d she said. \u201cLet\u2019s hope the autumn strategic review will bring a much more coherent, bigger and bolder approach that really gets it done.\u201d\nHeating remains a major source of carbon and the government plans to open a grant scheme from April 2022 to help households and small businesses invest in heat pumps and biomass boilers, backed by \u00a3100m of exchequer funding.\nIt will also invest a further \u00a3270m in a new green heat networks scheme which the Association for Decentralised Energy estimates could help connect 4.25m homes to heat networks by 2050, from 500,000 today.\nThe government also confirmed plans to introduce a plastic packaging tax under which producers and importers will pay \u00a3200 a tonne on wrappings with less than 30% recycled content from April 2022.\nGreen campaigners welcomed the tax but questioned why the government was waiting another two years to introduce it.", "label": 0}, "dev-15": {"text": "Wind and solar plants will soon be cheaper than coal in all big markets around world, analysis finds\nBuilding new wind and solar plants will soon be cheaper in every major market across the globe than running existing coal-fired power stations, according to a new report that raises fresh doubt about the medium-term viability of Australia\u2019s $26bn thermal coal export industry.\nWhile some countries are moving faster than others, the analysis by the Carbon Tracker Initiative, a climate finance thinktank, found renewable power was a cheaper option than building new coal plants in all large markets including Australia, and was expected to cost less than electricity from existing coal plants by 2030 at the latest.\nSolar photovoltaics and wind energy were already cheaper than electricity from about 60% of coal stations, including about 70% of China\u2019s coal fleet and half of Australia\u2019s plants, it said.\nIn Japan, where Australia sells nearly half its exported thermal coal, wind power was found to cost less than new coal plants and was expected to be cheaper than existing coal by 2028. Solar power in Japan was forecast to be a better option than new coal by 2023 and existing coal by 2026.\nThe story was similar in China and South Korea, which each take about 15% of Australia\u2019s exported thermal coal. In China, wind was already cheaper than any coal power, and solar electricity was forecast to on average cost less than existing coal later this year. Renewable energy in South Korea was expected to be cheaper than existing coal within two years.\nThe report acknowledged this trend did not necessarily mean coal power would be pushed from the market within a decade. It said some governments were effectively incentivising or underwriting new coal power through regulatory programs that either directly subsidised coal operators or passed the higher cost on to consumers.\nBut the group found that coal power would struggle if markets were priced fairly. It called on governments to block new coal projects and phase our existing coal plants, in part by changing regulations to allow renewable energy to compete on a level playing field.\nCarbon Tracker\u2019s Matt Gray, a co-author of the report, said proposed coal investments risked becoming stranded assets that locked in increasingly expensive power for decades. The analysis found that developers risked wasting more than $600bn if all mooted coal-fired plants were built.\n\u201cThe market is driving the low-carbon energy transition but governments aren\u2019t listening,\u201d Gray said. \u201cIt makes economic sense for governments to cancel new coal projects immediately and progressively phase out existing plants.\u201d\nChristiana Figueres, a former head UN climate chief who oversaw negotiations on the Paris agreement and is in Australian on a book tour, said demand for coal had been diminishing, having been overtaken by cheaper gas-fired power in the US and outpriced by solar in India. She said the price of solar and onshore and offshore wind were falling consistently.\n\u201cNo one should not assume that the demand for thermal coal from Australia is actually elastic. It\u2019s not,\u201d Figueres said.\nAustralia is the world\u2019s second largest thermal coal exporter after Indonesia, and is the biggest trader in metallurgical coal, which is used in steel making.\nThe export value of both forms of coal dropped notably last year. The spot price of thermal coal slumped more than a third from US$100.73 to US$66.20, its biggest fall in more than a decade.\nBefore the coronavirus outbreak, the government\u2019s latest resources and quarterly energy report estimated the declining price would cut earnings from thermal coal exports from a record A$26bn in 2018-19 to A$20.6bn this financial year.\nIn terms of coal use, the International Energy Agency found it declined last year, but forecast a slight increase over the next five years due to rising demand from India.\nA more detailed analysis by several thinktanks found that coal-fired electricity fell about 3% in 2019, the biggest drop on record after more than four decades of near-uninterrupted growth in which coal power has been a primary driver of the climate crisis. China\u2019s use of coal plants continued to climb while generation in the US and Europe fell by 16% and nearly a quarter.\nWithin Australia, black and brown coal provide about two-thirds of the electricity used in the five eastern states, but this is expected to fall as old plants continue to close. According to federal government projections, renewable energy is expected to meet nearly 50% of national demand by 2030.\nIn 2018 the UN\u2019s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change examined how rapidly global coal power needed to be phased out to give the world a chance of limiting global warming to 1.5C , a goal referenced in the Paris agreement.\nIt found this would require a cut of 59% to 78% below 2010 levels by 2030, before declining to zero.", "label": 0}, "dev-16": {"text": "Upcoming talks in Washington, D.C. and Baltimore\nI will be speaking next week in Baltimore and Washington, D.C., in a pair of events organized by the Jewish National Fund.

He\u2019s also promised to void the Paris Agreement on climate change, which he views as an executive agreement between Obama and the United Nations that will expire when he takes the oath.\nThese represent a\u00a0major dismantling of Obama\u2019s (and\u00a0Hillary Clinton\u2019s) climate agenda, and Trump will certainly be criticized as a\u00a0scientific Neanderthal for doing so. After all, scientists worldwide have complicated computer models that agree on dramatic warming. As we here about, \u201cthe science is settled.\u201d\nThere are other constructive things a\u00a0President Trump could do to advance climate science \u2014 and there\u2019s actual growing support in the climate science community for such actions.\n\nMost climate science is based not upon observed changes in temperature but rather on what complex computer models project the climate will be like decades or centuries from now. Much of the argument in the field is based on how accurate those projections will be, and if it is wise to base expensive policies on such questionable evidence. Yes, surface temperatures will warm up this century, but many models predict far more lower atmospheric warming than is being observed.\nAs Trump was making his unlikely comeback, an equally\u00a0remarkable report appeared in \u201cScience\u201d\u00a0that may be very enlightening as to how the disparity between models and reality arose, and why climate scientists have been so loath to acknowledge it. It is also leaves a\u00a0roadmap for the new administration to cure this systematically ailing field of study.\nAs projections come not from current data but instead predictions, models must be \u201cadjusted\u201d because of their inability to simulate temperature behavior of the past 100\u00a0years when left to their own devices. But only now are researchers becoming more forthright about these adjustments.\nAs noted in the \u201cScience\u201d piece, there were two reasons for keeping it secret. Modellers feared when these adjustments became public knowledge, people might be a\u00a0bit reluctant to believe their forecasts for the future \u2014 and that whatever political will there really is for expensive emissions reductions would evaporate.\nNow that fudging \u2014 or \u201cadjusting,\u201d as \u201cScience\u201d puts it \u2014 has come out of the closet, Trump can do a\u00a0great deal to shine sunlight on it.\nFirst, as a\u00a0condition of continued public funding, how about complete transparency? Modellers need to reveal all the \u201cadjustments\u201d in their model code that aren\u2019t derived from basic physics and present them to the larger scientific community. Right now, the move afoot is to force complete sharing only between modellers. Transparency should mean transparency. That includes all scientists, and all the public.\nThe new administration also needs to find out why there has been no real narrowing of the wide range of future forecasts for 40 \u2014 yes, 40 \u2014 years, despite billions upon billions of dollars directed toward refining the forecast.\nThe answer is either going to be that climate modellers are all consciously or subliminally colluding to produce similar results, or that they are simply so good at climate modelling that they all get the same answer despite different methods and different \u201cadjustments.\u201d\nIn the latter case it looks like the climate modellers have done their job, and there\u2019s no need for future public support.\nThat\u2019s precisely what happened in Australia when conservative Prime Minister Tony Abbott took over in a\u00a02013 election that looked an awful lot like ours of 2016.

Scott Morrison says it over and over: there is no dispute about the need to take action to reduce Australia\u2019s emissions. No dispute. You are getting sleepy. No dispute.\nIn fact there is a dispute, and a serious one. By failing to do what is necessary, the government Morrison leads maintains a serious dispute with what the climate science tells us needs to be done both in Australia and internationally to avert the most dangerous risks associated with global heating.\nWhen it comes to mitigation, Morrison\u2019s government is in dispute with the facts.\nIt is in dispute with the evidence.\nIt is in dispute with the truth.\nDay in, day out.\nSo despite his gritted-teeth soothing and head-patting from the podium at the National Press Club on Wednesday after a summer of calamity, there\u2019s a dispute alright, and it\u2019s one of the most important disputes of our time.\nThis dispute is about the future, and how our government shapes it on our behalf. The dispute turns on whether climate change is now all about adaptation, about adjusting and adapting to the new reality \u2013 or whether Australia, as a responsible, reformist, middle power, is still at the policy and diplomatic barricades trying to avoid the worst case scenario.\nDear prime minister. That\u2019s a big dispute. Big with a capital B. And this is a dispute that every citizen of this country, and every citizen of the world, has a direct stake in.\nHere\u2019s one piece of advice for all you good folks who watched Morrison\u2019s scene setter at the press club: do not consent to having your head patted.\nDo not consent to the high stakes hypnotism. When the prime minister says \u201ctaking action is agreed\u201d, do feel free to say to yourself or to anyone around you: \u201cNo, it isn\u2019t agreed.\u201d\nIf so inclined, add this: \u201cClimate action remains contested, and it remains contested because the Coalition chose to weaponise climate change at the precise moment in history when we needed to get about solving it.\u201d\nIf you feel on a roll at this point, add this: \u201cAnd this political party still weaponises climate change against its opponents if it feels there\u2019s an electoral advantage in doing so.\u201d\nMorrison told us, blithely, on Wednesday, that solving the challenge of climate change goes beyond targets and summits. It will be driven by technology, not by taxes \u2013 a convenient sort of rationalisation \u2013 as if this was all unavoidable, inexorable, a fixed set of conditions, rather than a choice, and a choice the Coalition has been at the epicentre of.\nSome facts. When we had a \u201ctax\u201d on carbon in Australia (that wasn\u2019t a tax, either then, or now), emissions came down, which is what the science tells us needs to happen. When the Coalition repealed that \u201ctax\u201d (that wasn\u2019t a tax, then, or now), emissions crept up, which is what the science tells us is dangerous. As my colleague Adam Morton has reported countless times, national emissions peaked in 2007, the last year of the Howard government, came down each year under the Rudd and Gillard Labor governments, and have flatlined since the Coalition was elected in 2013.\nReversing that positive trajectory of abatement was a choice the Coalition made.\nIt wasn\u2019t something that the universe imposed arbitrarily on the government, a bit of happenstance. It was a choice these people, including Morrison, made. Eyes wide open.\nAnother fact. When Australia went to the United Nations climate talks late last year and argued we should use carryover credits from the Kyoto period \u2013 an accounting fix that means Australia will promise to reduce our emissions by 26% but in practice only reduce our emissions by about half that headline number \u2013 that was a choice too. We made a choice to do less than is necessary, hurting ourselves in the long term, and making it harder to sustain any sort of global consensus for ambitious action.\nThese things aren\u2019t happening because of strange, alien forces beyond our collective control. They are happening because our government is choosing to fail on climate change mitigation.\nI\u2019ll say it again because it\u2019s important, and inexplicable, no matter how long you look at the same set of facts hoping to comprehend the incomprehensible: our government is choosing to fail, and trying to make a virtue of it.\nOur government has access to the science, to the best advice available, and yet it continues to shirk the mitigation challenge. It continues to gamble with the future in the worst way imaginable.\nMorrison still has time to turn this appalling behaviour around, and there are some interesting markers if you can penetrate his various maxims and misdirections. Working with the states on bilateral agreements to reduce emissions is one hint worth watching. I suspect our prime minister is still hedging his bets and refining his thoughts.\nBut until actions follow words, there is only one reliable measure to judge the government on.

Only seven producers managed to make it in 2017, and only five in 2013. It did not say how far back records went.\n\u201cIf warm winters become more frequent over the coming years, ice wines from Germany\u2019s regions will will soon become an even more expensive rarity than they already are,\u201d said Ernst B\u00fcscher, a spokesman for the institute.\nFreezing the grapes before they are crushed concentrates the sugar and leads to an intensely sweet wine often served with dessert. It has always been a niche product, accounting for about 0.1% of German production, and the low volumes make it expensive.\nMaking ice wine is a tricky business. Workers must race into the vineyards to harvest the grapes with only a few hours notice when the temperature falls, often at night or in the early morning. The grapes have to be pressed while still frozen, so the winemakers work in unheated facilities. Vineyard owners also face the risk that grapes set aside for ice wine will rot on the vine before the temperature drops far enough.\nCanada\u2019s Niagara peninsula is one of several other places where ice wine is produced, thanks to its cold winters.

It mostly runs on clean hydro power and has already reached 100% renewable energy generation in some years. But analysts said, if delivered, the shift in Tasmania could provide an example for others to follow.\nAnna Skarbek, chief executive of research organisation ClimateWorks, said the new Tasmanian commitments were consistent with what other countries and jurisdictions that ran on hydro were doing. They are also in line with what analysts have found: that Australia had great potential to be a clean energy industrial hub.\n\u201cIt is a good example of a government looking at opportunities for future clean energy markets,\u201d Skarbek said. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve found is, when the intent is signalled, international technology providers are looking for opportunities to invest in other jurisdictions.\u201d\nThe most fleshed-out element of the Tasmanian commitment is a promise to offer $50m in funding, concessional loans, subsidised power and tax breaks for green hydrogen development over the next decade. Making hydrogen is an electricity-hungry process that involves using an electrolyser to split water into hydrogen and oxygen.\nWith a report for the Australian Renewable Energy Agency having estimated an Australian industry could be worth up to $10bn a year by 2040, Gutwein said hydrogen was \u201cone of the most extraordinary sunrise opportunities Tasmania could ever step into\u201d.\nHe said the state had already received interest from companies in Japan, Korea and Singapore, and cited forecasts hydrogen produced with clean power would have about a 15% price advantage over fossil fuel-derived hydrogen. \u201cWe know that with our renewable energy that we can generate green hydrogen cheaper than what they will be able to on the mainland,\u201d he said.\nThe other elements Gutwein announced remain little more than dot points. He has promised a renewable energy action plan in April, and a plan in the state budget for the government to have more electric cars in its fleet.\nLocally, the commitments received a largely, but not universally, positive response. Politically, Tasmanian Labor said they were welcome but long overdue; the Greens said they were welcome but nothing like enough to take the climate emergency seriously, and said they would introduce a bill that would go further.\nOutside parliament, the Wilderness Society described the new pledges as refreshing, while the Australia Institute, a progressive thinktank, said the green hydrogen vision was a \u201cforward thinking plan for the state\u201d.\n\u201cIt\u2019s great to see the Tasmanian government backing our renewable energy sector by investing in this emerging industry,\u201d said Leanne Minshull, the Australia Institute\u2019s Tasmanian director.\nBut both organisations had caveats. Minshull said the massive clean energy expansion should be used to drive Tasmania to zero emissions, including by moving the state\u2019s vehicles and farms to running on electricity and attracting further clean industries to the state, before more was exported to the mainland via new undersea cables, including the proposed Marinus Link with Victoria.\nTom Allen, from the Wilderness Society, said the state\u2019s first step in cutting emissions should be to end native forest logging. He said the government still intended to log 226 forest reserves that contained more than 10m tonnes of carbon.\n\u201cIf this logging happens it would obliterate all the environmental policies he announced this week,\u201d he said. \u201cThe quickest, easiest, lowest-cost way to boost Tasmania\u2019s carbon stocks, protect wildlife and provide new, badly needed nature recreation spaces is to permanently protect these outstanding reserves.\u201d", "label": 0}, "dev-21": {"text": "The College Football Grid of Angst\nAnyone who follows college football has come to understand that gruesome, annual torture is the defining element of being a fan. Emotional distress is a byproduct of this sport. There\u2019s the player turnover, the ridiculous officiating, the huge stakes for what seems like every single game and, above all else, the fact that teenagers are involved. So you\u2019re never quite sure if your team is on the verge of historical greatness or if it\u2019s about to fall face-first into a canyon. But this season has been especially chaotic, and many of college football\u2019s top teams have been enormously volatile. Some schools that no one saw coming still have a legitimate shot at the College Football Playoff. Then there are the teams that have crashed from contention and wrenched the emotions of their beleaguered fans. So now, ahead of Saturday\u2019s conference championships and with the regular season essentially over, it\u2019s a good time for every fan to take stock and answer a simple question: Was it worth it? To calculate the \u201cangst\u201d of all relevant teams, we graded them on their volatility\u2014or how much they moved in the polls from week to week. Let\u2019s use Ohio State as an example. The defending national champions probably won\u2019t make the playoff this year, but their season was quite stable: The Buckeyes never slipped lower than the top ranks until their loss to Michigan State two weeks ago. Southern California fans, by contrast, spent the entire season trying to figure out if their team was good enough to get excited about or bad enough to ignore. A chart of their week-by-week spot in the top-25 looks like something you need to be t his tall to ride. A bumpy ride, though, isn\u2019t so bad if you end up where you wanted to be all along. That\u2019s why we also measured another variable: satisfaction. Stanford was a pogo stick of a football team this season, but the Cardinal can still sneak into the playoff if things go their way this weekend. Above is a breakdown of 2015\u2019s ranked teams and the stress they caused\u2014with explanations for the standouts. Clemson ( Highest rank: #1 ; lowest rank: #12) Somehow a team that has become a synonym for crushing disappointment gave its fans something they\u2019ve been unaccustomed to: tranquility. Clemson sailed through the season unbeaten thanks to the stellar play of quarterback DeShaun Watson. The Tigers enter the final weekend of the season ranked No. 1 and as an overwhelming favorite to take the ACC title. What could possibly go wrong? Alabama ( Highest rank: #1 ; lowest rank: #8) Alabama tiptoed into this season with an unproven quarterback and still had an uphill road after an early loss\u2014which is exactly what happened before the Crimson Tide was the playoff\u2019s No. 1 seed last year. Alabama\u2019s season appears worth it now, but maybe not if Nick Saban\u2019s team gets upset in the semifinal again. Oklahoma ( Highest rank: #3 ; lowest rank: #19) Oklahoma fans had become restless in recent years with underachieving teams that had been overtaken by the Big 12 teams that they believe to be inferior. This season is the first time since realignment that Oklahoma\u2019s fans can have their cake and eat it, too. The cherry on top: The Sooners almost certainly clinched their playoff spot with a win against in-state rival Oklahoma State. Iowa ( Highest rank: #4 ; weeks unranked: 5) Much like its ball-control offense, Iowa relied on a series of steady gains that didn\u2019t have anyone jumping out of their seat, but ultimately got the Hawkeyes where they wanted to go: the Big Ten title game. North Carolina ( Highest rank: #8 ; weeks unranked: 9) It seemed like a disaster when North Carolina dominated South Carolina in its season-opener and still found a way to lose. But that hasn\u2019t happened since. The Tar Heels have won 11 in a row and enter the ACC championship Saturday as a longshot playoff candidate and a legitimate threat to spoil Clemson\u2019s season. That\u2019s more than enough for a school and athletic department that hasn\u2019t yet escaped the dark cloud of its academic scandal. Stanford ( Highest rank: #7 ; weeks unranked: 2) It didn\u2019t take long for Stanford fans to start feeling queasy about this season. The Cardinal dropped their opening game at Northwestern before most of them had finished brunch. Stanford rebounded to win 10 of its next 11 games, but its season could be bookended by anguish if it wins the Pac-12 on Saturday but misses out on a playoff spot. Southern California ( Highest rank: #6 ; weeks unranked: 6) USC lost this season to three teams that the Trojans have come to hate: Stanford, Notre Dame and Oregon. USC coach Steve Sarkisian also was fired in the middle of the season. But they still crushed UCLA and play for the Pac-12 championship Saturday. USC\u2019s season was incredibly strange and it may get even weirder. Houston ( Highest rank: #13 ; weeks unranked: 6) The only discomforting part of Houston\u2019s season was the team\u2019s rocket-like trajectory under first-year coach Tom Herman. The Cougars opened the season with 10 straight wins and enter this weekend\u2019s American Conference title game as the highest-ranked school outside the Power 5 conferences. Michigan ( Highest rank: #12 ; weeks unranked: 4) The most angsty and volatile moment this season was the botched Michigan punt that blew the Wolverines\u2019 win over Michigan State and... well, we\u2019d say more, but Michigan fans appear to be hyperventilating already. But the truth is Jim Harbaugh\u2019s first season was relatively stable compared to previous years: The Wolverines lost to better teams and beat everyone else. That\u2019s progress. Northwestern (Highest rank: #13; weeks unranked: 5) Behold perhaps the topsy-turviest team this season: Northwestern? In recent seasons, the Wildcats had become better known for their push to unionize than anything they did on the football field. They started this season by upsetting Stanford, then climbed to No. 13 in the rankings, then dropped out of the top 25, then returned to right where they were. Ohio State (Highest rank: #1; lowest rank: 8) Ohio State\u2019s season was going to be a roller-coaster as soon as they won the national title. Despite all the loops\u2014from the heated quarterback race to the star running back questioning the coach\u2019s play-calling\u2014it turns out the Buckeyes were the least volatile team in the country. But the stability didn\u2019t bring them any satisfaction: One late-season loss will probably keep Ohio State out of the playoff. Baylor (Highest rank: #2; lowest rank: 10) For most of the season, the closest Baylor fans came to a feeling of uneasiness was the fear they might blink and miss a touchdown. The Bears won their first eight games this season by an average margin of 32 points and appeared playoff-bound. But calamity struck late: Baylor lost its top two quarterbacks to injury and dropped two games, including a grudge match to TCU. Auburn (Highest rank: #6; weeks unranked: 11) Auburn picked a terrible season to unveil a colossal new scoreboard. The Tigers had lofty expectations as a preseason top-10 team. Then the season actually started. Auburn finished dead last in its division\u2014and its only SEC wins came on the road. That scoreboard was a massive reminder of what went wrong. VOLATILE\u2014AND NOT WORTH THE TROUBLE Louisiana State (Highest rank: #4; weeks unranked: 1) Home to one of college football\u2019s most riotous tailgates, LSU fans are accustomed to feelings of unbridled joy being quickly replaced by a throbbing headache. But the hangover came early to Baton Rouge this season. Seemingly headed to the playoff midway through the season and with a presumptive Heisman winner in Leonard Fournette, the Tigers fell apart down the stretch. Georgia (Highest rank: #7; weeks unranked: 8) Most teams would take a three-loss season and go home happy. Georgia had a three-loss season, and Mark Richt is now the coach at Miami. That\u2019s because those three losses came in Georgia\u2019s three most important games of a season that saw the Bulldogs ranked as high as No. 7 and as low as where they are now: unranked.", "label": 0}, "dev-22": {"text": "Trapped Americans Flown Out of Violence-Torn City in South Sudan\nAmerican relief workers trapped in Bor, South Sudan, were evacuated Sunday aboard United Nations helicopters that took them to the capital city of Juba. Three U.S. military aircraft sent to evacuate the Americans from Bor on Saturday came under small arms fire from undetermined forces forcing the mission to be aborted. Four U.S. military service members aboard were injured by the fire. \u201cThis morning, the United States \u2014 in coordination with the United Nations and in consultation with the South Sudanese government \u2014 safely evacuated American citizens from Bor, South Sudan, \u201d said State Department spokesperson Jen Psaki in a statement released Sunday. Psaki said that an unspecified number of Americans and citizens from other partner nations \u201cwere flown from Bor to Juba on U.N. and U.S. civilian helicopters.\u201d In light of Saturday\u2019s incident Psaki said that both the United States and the United Nations \u201ctook steps to ensure fighting factions were aware these flights were a humanitarian mission.\u201d Violence broke out earlier this week between rival factions of South Sudan\u2019s military, and there is concern that the violence could become a full-blown civil war. Hundreds have been killed in the fighting which has mainly taken place in the capital city of Juba. Bor, in the eastern state of Jonglei, has also seen heavy violence and is reportedly controlled by the military faction not loyal to the government. The Americans in Bor were transported out aboard flights organized by the United Nations to evacuate its civilian staff from the area, where as many as 15,000 have sought refuge from the fighting at the U.N. compound. The United Nations Mission in South Sudan said Sunday that they were relocating their non-essential staff from Juba to Uganda and would beef up its military peacekeeper presence in Bor as part of their commitment to protect the civilian population. \u201cWe are not abandoning South Sudan. We are here to stay, and will carry on in our collective resolve to work with and for the people of South Sudan,\u201d said Hilde F. Johnson, the Special Representative of the UN Secretary-General for South Sudan. \u201cTo anyone who wants to threaten us, attack us or put obstacles in our way, our message remains loud and clear: we will not be intimidated.\u201d Overall the State Department has evacuated 380 Americans and 300 other foreign nationals out of South Sudan, which has erupted in violence over the past weeks as two military factions struggle for power. The Americans have been transported out on four military flights and five military aircraft. Psaki urged any Americans in South Sudan to \u201cdepart immediately\u201d and encouraged them to remain in contact with the U.S. embassy in the capital city of Juba. According to Psaki \u201cthe U.S. government is doing everything possible to ensure the safety and security of United States citizens in South Sudan. We are working with our allies around the world to connect with and evacuate U.S. citizens as quickly and safely as possible. For their safety and security, we will not outline specific evacuation plans.\u201d On Saturday the State Department declined to answer how many Americans in Bor were to have been evacuated by the American Osprey aircraft, citing ongoing concerns for their safety. The Ospreys took ground fire on Saturday as they approached a landing site where the Americans had gathered. U.N. Mission to South Sudan spokesman Jose Contreras confirmed to ABC News that a U.N. helicopter conducting an evacuation mission in the nearby town of Yuai on Friday also took small arms fire. All the crew and passengers aboard the helicopter were able to return safely to a U.N. base. On Monday, two U.S. military C-130 aircraft evacuated 120 American and western diplomats from Juba after the State Department requested U.S. military assistance in evacuating non-emergency personnel. The planes also carried in 45 members of the U.S. military\u2019s East Africa Response Force (EARF) to stay behind in Juba to protect the U.S. embassy and the American diplomats who remained behind. The EARF is one of two U.S. military quick response forces for Africa established after the Benghazi consulate attack. The response force of 500 Marines based in Spain can respond to crises in North and West Africa, the smaller 100 man EARF is based in Djibouti and can respond to emergency situations in eastern Africa. Just this week the U.S. military was wrapping up an airlift mission to the neighboring Central African Republic that is also in the middle of a violent crisis. For the last two weeks two U.S. Air Force C-17 aircraft had transported more than 800 Burundian troops and their equipment to assist with peacekeeping efforts there.

Kirch: How to Fix the Doctor Shortage\nCongress is poised to pass a health-care overhaul that would expand insurance coverage to 31 million Americans, but will the newly insured have a physician to care for them? Our nation currently faces a shortage of physicians expected to worsen as the number of people over age 65 (who use more than twice the health care of younger adults) doubles. Even with significant changes to the health-care delivery system and improved prevention, the United States will face a shortage of more than 125,000 physicians in the next 15 years\u2014a daunting problem considering that we only train about 27,000 new doctors a year. In addition, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) estimates that at least 16,000 more primary care physicians are needed today. The shortage of primary care physicians and other health professionals is further complicated by an overall physician shortage in most areas of the country. In 2001, new patients were forced to wait an average of eight days to see a family or general practitioner. Overall wait times for all physicians reached almost 15 days that year. Without significant increases in the number of doctors, these delays will only get worse. On average, it takes three to seven years to fully train a new physician through a process known as residency training (the graduate medical education that all physicians must undergo after eight years of college and medical school). While U.S. medical schools are working to increase their classes by 30%, these new medical school graduates will not increase the nation's overall supply of physicians, or even have a residency position in which to train, unless the government lifts the cap on residency training slots it pays for that was imposed as part of the Balanced Budget Act in 1997. The doctor shortage affects primary care as well as many medical specialties, even without an expansion of health insurance. According to HHS, overall demand for physician services will increase an estimated 22% between 2005 and 2020, while the number of primary care physicians will increase by only 18% during this period. Worse, the supply of some doctors (such as urologists and general surgeons) is expected to shrink over this period despite the government's assessment that the need for almost all types of physicians will continue to grow. Researchers have suggested that only one specialty, general pediatrics, will have a supply of physicians greater than the demand for their care. But even this surplus seems highly improbable to those of us with children who already have difficulty obtaining timely appointments. The U.S. health work force has been rightly criticized because the percentage of physicians in primary care is lower than in most of the developed nations to which we often compare our health system. This is a problem many see as directly related to poor reimbursement for primary care services. Yet the number of formally trained family physicians (doctors who care for patients of all ages) doubled between 1985 and 2004, and we still remain without enough doctors in primary care and many other medical fields. The physician shortage is, in part, a result of expectations in the 1990s that managed care and primary care would greatly drive down the need for physicians, particularly specialists. However, these expectations fell short against the rising needs of an aging, growing population that has high expectations of its health-care system. Today, the overall number of physicians in the U.S. is lower than the average per capita number of doctors in other nations such as Sweden, Denmark, Spain and France, and we now \"import\" some 25% of our physicians from other countries. While expansions of U.S. medical schools can close this part of the gap, the overall per capita supply of doctors in the country will decline without an expansion in the number of residency training positions. This expansion will not occur unless Medicare resumes paying for its share of training costs. Because it takes so long to train a new physician, Congress must lift the freeze on support for medical training now, as part of health-care reform. While the cost to add new physicians is significant, it is less than 1% of current Medicare expenditures and an essential investment if people are to have timely access to a physician's care, not just the promise of insurance coverage. Even those who expect the U.S. health-care system to be transformed in the next decade know that wishful thinking cannot provide the care they and their families will need. Congress is right to expand insurance to as many Americans as possible. But it also has a responsibility to ensure that the nation is cared for by more than an insurance card and an answering machine.

(Photo by Kevork S. Djansezian/Getty Images) The story inside paints Jolie as a heartless figure who used the plane incident to take Pitt's kids away from him. \"Angie says she is going to destroy him,\" a source told the tabloid. \"If something is broken, she just throws it away.\" Sources also suggested that Jolie had been plotting the divorce for a while, in order to better pursue a political career in the U.K. Adding to that narrative, Us Weekly published another story this morning that focuses more on Pitt and his parenting style. A source in the story claims that Pitt and Jolie had \"heated, screaming fights\" about how to raise their children, because Pitt wanted the kids to have more structure in their lives. \"Brad teaches them to be respectful human beings,\" the source said. \"Angelina lets the kids run around and behave badly.\" The source also claimed that Pitt wanted the kids to go to regular school, but Jolie insisted on homeschool to allow for travel. \"Brad wants them to have a normal upbringing and worries that they'll come out spoiled, elitist and not grounded,\" the source continued. \"But Angie feels they should be 'children of the world.'\" So this is Pitt's strategy. Instead of directly addressing the reports of abuse, he's gone to the magazines to create the narrative that he's just an average, salt-of-the-earth, strict dad dealing with a loosey-goosey, out-of-touch partner who wants to let the kids run wild. Will it work? That depends on what else Jolie has to say.

Her mentor would be proud of her pupil, and possibly even wrote Ardern\u2019s National Statement for her, delivered at the UN General Assembly to a sparse, disinterested and partially comatose audience.\nPredictably, Ardern spoke of \u201ckindness\u201d and \u201cclimate change\u201d but nestled in there were a couple of never-before-mentioned nuggets. Thank goodness some people back home were paying attention!\nJudith Collins was most unimpressed, her hackles rose and she tweeted \u201cBorderless!!! What in the world is this PM doing? Open borders??\u201d\nIndeed, what was Ardern thinking? Well, first and foremost we must remember that Ardern is a UN sycophant, more than happy to sit back and let them tell her how best to run the country \u2013 including opening our borders.\nBut Winston Peters was also paying attention, but more likely he was privy to the speech before it was delivered, because three days ago (Ardern delivered her speech two days ago),\u00a0he preempts the question, furiously backpedalling on his pre-election promise to \u201ccut immigration by up to 60,000 people a year.\u201d\n\u201cDeputy Prime Minister Winston Peters says the Government is striving to address the quality of immigration, saying \u2018it\u2019s not whether it\u2019s too high\u00a0it\u2019s\u00a0whether you are getting the right people\u2018 that matters most.\u201d\nA divided CoL aside, Ardern, crucially,\u00a0gives us our first insight into her patsy role at the UN\u00a0for Aunty Helen which is much\u00a0more about driving change than about representing us. She begins with Security Council reform.\n\u201c[\u2026] ultimately it is up to us \u2013 the Member States \u2013\u00a0to drive change at the UN.\u00a0This includes reforming the Security Council.\nIf we want the Council to fulfil its purpose of maintaining international peace and security, its practices need to be updated so it is not\u00a0hamstrung by the use of the veto.\u201d\nThe power of veto is available only to the\u00a0five permanent members\u00a0of the United Nations Security Council (China, France, Russia, United Kingdom, and the United States) and can only be used to prevent the adoption of any \u201csubstantive\u201d resolution. It is arguably the most important distinction between permanent and non-permanent members and also the most controversial aspect of UN operations.\n\u201cPermanent members use the veto to defend their national interests, to uphold a tenet of their foreign policy or, in some cases, to promote a single issue of particular importance to a state.\nSince 16 February 1946\u2014when the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) cast the first veto on a draft resolution regarding the withdrawal of foreign troops from Lebanon and Syria (S/PV.23)\u2014the veto has been recorded 290 times.\nIn the early years, the USSR cast most of the vetoes, with a considerable number of these used to block the admission of a new member state. Over the years,\nthe\u00a0USSR/Russia has cast a total of 141 vetoes, or close to half of all vetoes.\u00a0The US cast the first of its 83 vetoes to date on 17 March 1970\u00a0(S/9696 and Corr. 1 and 2).\nPlaying out in the UN is the struggle between the two most powerful nations \u2013 the USSR/Russia and the USA. The temptation for large nations to become catalysts for the decimation of much tinier nations in the Middle East and Africa because of their valuable national resources and strategic import can be too great to resist, and the UN has been largely impotent in stopping them.\nUntil the USA began exercising its veto right at the UN the USSR/Russia had dominated the Security Council but they are now arguably neck and neck, meaning removing the right to veto will equally dis-empower both. But behind this move is another. For the past year, the UN has been discussing reforming the Security Council, whether to add to the five permanent members or abolish the permanent member\u2019s veto power, or both, because African nations feel neglected and are clamouring for better representation.\n\u201cSierra Leone\u2019s representative, speaking on behalf of the African Group, spotlighted that most issues discussed in the 15?member organ are related to his continent.\u00a0 Its 54\u00a0nations must be involved in decisions concerning not only international peace and security, but its own very continent.\u00a0\u00a0Africa demands no less than two permanent seats, including the veto power, if it remains, and five non?permanent seats.\u00a0\u00a0Widespread support from Member States for this position means that it is time to\u00a0\u201credress the historical injustice of not being represented in the permanent category\u201d.\nIt seems highly likely Ardern is preparing the ground for satisfying African demands by the UN granting them permanent member status, but not the power of veto which it will deprive them of by removing it entirely.\nIt appears Ardern has waded into the dispute at someone else\u2019s behest and whether she\u00a0represents our values or not, she represents us.\n\u201cI\u2019m struck as a leader attending my first United Nations General Assembly by the power and potential that resides here. But in New Zealand,\u00a0we have always been acutely aware of that.\u201d", "label": 1}, "dev-30": {"text": "Microsoft Wants Its Wearable On Your Wrist And Your Health Data In Its Hands\nMicrosoft Microsoft has had a pretty tough time getting very far with smartphones. Maybe it will have better luck in wearables. As Forbes staff writer Parmy Olson first reported last May, Microsoft is getting into the wearables game, and today it finally showed its hand with the announcement of the Microsoft Band, a $199 fitness wearable that continuously tracks your heart rate. Available immediately in both online and physical Microsoft stores, the wearable is packed with 10 sensors\u2013such as GPS, an optical heart rate monitor and a UV light monitor. In addition to constantly tracking your heart rate, it also can track things like how many steps you\u2019ve taken, calories burned and your sleep quality. A Bluetooth radio in the wearable syncs the data up to your phone. Microsoft is claiming two days of usage and expects you to wear it all the time. It also has a few so-called smartwatch capabilities with text, email, social media and calendar alerts. The Band will work on iOS, Android and Windows Phone, but if you pair it with the Windows OS, you\u2019ll be able to use digital assistant Cortana, Microsoft version of Apple's Apple's Siri. You can tell Cortana on the device to give you information on weather, traffic or stocks as well as set reminders or take notes. On top of the wearable announcement, Microsoft is also coming out with Microsoft Health, a cloud-based service to store and analyze health data coming from multiple sources\u2013that includes data coming from competing health wearables. As with the watch, the cloud service is compatible with the three main mobile operation systems\u2013iOS, Android and Windows Phone. The app will analyze information such as how many calories you\u2019ve burned or how much sleep you\u2019re getting and then give you feedback on fitness goals you\u2019ve set. The Health platform has a number of partners starting out that it will work with, including UP by Jawbone, MapMyFitness, MyFitnessPal and RunKeeper. With this move, Microsoft is finally catching up to some of the competition of its fellow tech giants. Google Google and Apple have already begun offering their own platforms for centralizing and analyzing health data across a number of sources. Apple brought on HealthKit with its iOS 8 update and Google has its Google Fit for Android. The consumer market for fitness wearables is exceedingly crowded at the moment. There have been a number of new devices with a multitude of sensors and claims about battery life and accuracy. Basis, Intel's Intel's fitness wearable startup it acquired this year, unveiled its the Peak for $199 and will be available in November. Peak offers constant heart rate monitoring and claims five days of battery life over the Band\u2019s two. And fitness wearable maker Fitbit recently announced its $250 watch, Surge, available next year. Equipped with 10 sensors, the Microsoft Band is able to collect a lot more information than some of the other fitness wearables. For example, the UV sensor tracks your sun exposure and Microsoft can combine that with your other health data to find out how it relates to stress and health. But Microsoft consumer hardware products haven\u2019t always shined. Its Zune music player went nowhere and the future of its Surface tablet remains uncertain. Between April 2013 and March this year, 3.3 million fitness trackers were sold in the US, according to research firm NPD Group. But the whole wearables market is expected to grow rapidly now that Apple has staked its claim in the ground with the $349 Apple Watch that is expected out early next year.", "label": 0}, "dev-31": {"text": "Everyone Has to Change\u2026\n\u2026 says James Cameron.\nI loved Titanic and Avatar, just like I loved Love Actually and The Remains of the Day, both starring Emma Thompson.

Remember, as always, it is okay if they do it\u2026 we mere mortals just have to do as we are told.\nNow that James Cameron has adopted New Zealand as his home, temporarily at least, he has taken to the media to tell everyone how they should be living while striking at the industries that are the very backbone of our economy.\nNothing ever changes with these wealthy zealots, does it?\nOscar-winning director and self-described \u201cwannabe Kiwi\u201d James Cameron\u00a0has spoken about his dreams for a vegan future to TVNZ\u2019s\u00a0Sunday\u00a0programme.\nBut Cameron, who is vegan and alongside his wife Suzy\u00a0campaigns for worldwide reduction of animal farming and consumption,\u00a0also had a harsh message for our meat and dairy industry.\n\u201cThere are a lot of problems with meat,\u201d he said.\n\u201cGetting your protein from meat requires anywhere from 10 to 40 times as much land as getting the same exact nutritional value from plants.\u00a0What we need is\u00a0a nice transition to a\u00a0meatless\u00a0or relatively\u00a0meatless\u00a0world in 20 or 30 years.\u201d\nIn other words, he\u2019s a vegan, so he thinks everyone else should be a vegan too.\nCameron, who said that he saw climate change as leading to \u201cthe death of democracy as we know it,\u201d acknowledged that his view would be a contentious one.\u201cIt\u2019s the heart and soul and the DNA of the country,\u201d he told Casinader. \u201cI get that.\u201dThe Camerons have turned two large dairy farms over to organic vegetables, as well as hemp, linseed and rye corn, and elsewhere in the interview announced that they were\u00a0launching a plant-based food business with Sir Peter Jackson.\nSir Peter is not usually one to tell people how to live, so let\u2019s hope that he will not convert into a climate zealot along with his buddy James.\nBut\u00a0Cameron has angered his Wairarapa neighbours before\u00a0and is doing so again, with one farmer whose family has raised cattle in the area for 80 years calling Cameron\u2019s ideas \u201cabsolutely ridiculous\u201d.\nBut James Cameron makes blockbuster movies, so that makes him an expert on everything. Didn\u2019t you know that?\nCasinader also spoke to a spokesperson from Beef and Lamb New Zealand, who, as well as outlining the healthful properties of meat and dairy, also pointed out that New Zealand\u2019s typically hilly terrain was not well suited to crop farming.\nAlso, in case you hadn\u2019t noticed, Mr Cameron, New Zealand is not exactly lacking in land available for farming. We never seem to have enough land when it comes to building houses, but, for agriculture \u2013 no problem.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not here to get New Zealanders to change,\u201d Cameron said in response. \u201cEverybody has to change.\u201d\nWhich means, according to James Cameron, that New Zealanders do have to change, and our economy will be destroyed as a result of his climate whims.\n\u201cNew Zealand isn\u2019t living up to its own image of itself and the image that it projects to the world as the clean, green place,\u201d he said, pointing to pollution in rivers and lakes as an example.\nYes, there is pollution in some rivers and lakes, but there is also terrible pollution on Auckland\u2019s beaches which has nothing to do with agriculture. But, like all other climate groupies, Cameron sees agriculture as the big bad wolf, ignoring all other causes of pollution and degradation.\n\u201cWe\u2019re happy to live here, we want to be good responsible New Zealanders.", "label": 1}, "dev-32": {"text": "Save the Polar Bears? They\u2019re Fine, Actually\nTwo years ago, following guidance from the U.S. Geological Survey, the federal Fish and Wildlife Service officially listed the polar bear as a\u00a0threatened species under the Endangered Species Act. The idea is that global warming will reduce\u2014or even eliminate\u2014sea ice in the Arctic Ocean at the end of summer, and this is where the bears go fishing.\nBut recent scientific findings (as well as some older ones) show that the polar bear has survived several millennia with little or no sea\u2010\u200bice. The ruling was clearly based upon less than the totality of science, and we should hope that the Survey\u2019s new chief, Suzette Kimball, who was schooled in the proud tradition of the Survey to put \u201cscience first,\u201d will see fit to advise the Fish and Wildlife Service to de\u2010\u200blist the bears.\nThis Earth Day, it\u2019s time to give the polar bear the respect it deserves. Nothing humans can do to the climate is going to wipe it out.\n\nThat\u2019s because we can\u2019t change the Arctic as much as Nature has during the bear\u2019s existence.\nConsider this: after the end of the most recent ice age, for three millennia, from around six to nine thousand years ago, the high arctic was nearly 13\u00b0F warmer in July than its 20th\u00a0century average.\u00a0We know this\u00a0because there are trees buried in what is now barren tundra that carbon\u2010\u200bdate back to that era. During the warm era, the boreal forest (aka the \u201cnorth woods\u201d) extended all the way to the Arctic Ocean and even onto the few islands that dot the sea. For the forest to exist, that\u2019s how much warmer it had to have been there during the summer.\nAccording to the Geological Survey of Norway, \u201cThe Arctic Ocean may have been periodically ice\u2010\u200bfree\u201d at this time.\u00a0Martin Jakobsson of Stockholm University wrote\u00a0in\u00a0Quaternary Science Reviews that there were \u201cperiods of ice free summers in large parts of the central Arctic Ocean.\u201d And the polar bear survived.\nLet\u2019s say humans could warm it up that much (which seems a\u00a0bit of a\u00a0stretch). We still couldn\u2019t sustain it for even one millennium \u2014 more likely, at best a\u00a0few hundred years. The likelihood that we will still be running on our current mix of energy one or two hundred years from now seems very low, given the historical record of energy evolution. That means the heat load that the polar bear tolerated after the end of the last ice age was about six times (assuming 500\u00a0years) what humans could foist upon them.\nIt gets even more interesting. Ice core data from Greenland reveals a\u00a0very unstable climate from 12,700 to 14,700\u00a0years ago \u2014 which is within the ice age.\u00a0Christian Stranne and his colleagues writing in\u00a0Quaternary Science Reviews in 2014[sciencedirect.com]\u00a0(after the bear was listed) note that this period was punctuated with arctic ice oscillating from a\u00a0permanent cover to periods without perennial cover. In other words, even in the end stage of the last ice age, the Arctic Ocean was ice\u2010\u200bfree at the end of summer for long periods. And the polar bear survived.\nTemperatures at the end of the previous ice age were even warmer. Isotopes trapped in ice cores show that summer temperatures in Northwest Greenland averaged an astounding 11\u00b0F warmer than last century,\u00a0for 6,000\u00a0years beginning about 128,000\u00a0years ago. This was revealed in\u00a0astounding 2013\u00a0Nature\u00a0paper by Dorthe Dahl\u2010\u200bJensen and her team of ice drillers. That\u2019s beyond an order\u2010\u200bof\u2010\u200bmagnitude more heat than humans could possibly unload on the ice. And the polar bear survived.\nThis very warm period is known as the Eemian thermal maximum. In 2010, Charlotte Lindqvist of State Univeristy of New York\u2010\u200bBuffalo\u00a0sequenced the DNA of an Alaskan bone fragment\u00a0between 110,000 and 130,000\u00a0years old (i.e. in or near the Eemian) and found it to be that of \u2014 yes \u2014 a\u00a0polar bear. \u201cThis means polar bears definitely persisted through warming periods during Earth\u2019s history,\u201d she said.\nJust last year, Thomas Cronin (U.S. Geological Survey) and University of Alaska\u2019s Matthew Cronin, combining work on paleoclimate and molecular genetics,\u00a0determined that there have been no extinctions of arctic marine mammals during the past 1.5 million years. That means the polar bear is highly adaptable, having survived multiple periods of integrated warming in the Arctic that dwarf what humans might accomplish.\nAlso, there\u2019s genetic evidence that when things get warm, the polar bear intermingles with the Alaskan brown bear, adaptably changing its way of life to accommodate a\u00a0changing climate. So they\u2019re not even a\u00a0separate species in the strict definition of the word. And when the arctic reverts to perennial ice, perhaps natural selection favors the white camouflage outfit.\nThen there\u2019s the present. The largest and furthest\u2010\u200bsouth polar bear population is in the Davis Straight, off of northeast and eastern Canada. It stretches all the way down to Newfoundland. With warming, one would think that the southern populations should be the most vulnerable, but,\u00a0according to Environment Canada, the population there is growing.\nThe polar bear seems pretty tough, having survived long stretches where the Arctic Ice was likely gone at the end of summer. It survived the heat of the beginning of the previous interglacial, which was much warmer than the beginning of this one, which itself was much warmer over time than we can make it.\nIt\u2019s high time for the Geological Survey to go back to \u201cscience first\u201d and advise Fish and Wildlife to take it off the \u201cthreatened\u201d list. \u201cHappy Earth Day\u201d to the polar bear!", "label": 1}, "dev-33": {"text": "Gadget Gift Guide: Picks for Pet Lovers\nWhile Prancer and Vixen help bring Christmas cheer, it\u2019s Fido and Fluffy we\u2019re thinking of more and more this time of year. Americans spend an average of $5 billion on their pets during the holidays and more than $50 billion on them annually, according to the American Pet Products Association. Since more than 60 percent of American households have pets, something for Butch or Roxy (or Lucky or Missy) might be the perfect gift solution for the pet lovers on your list. But hang up the boring old leash and consider upgrading to something more high-tech. Here are our top picks for best gadgets for pet lovers, part of our ABC News holiday gift guide series. We admit some of them are on the splurge side. Is your dog spending the day as a couch potato or is he hopping the fence and roaming free? Tagg can tell you. Produced by Snaptracs, Tagg is a GPS-tracking enabled clip-on for any dog collar. It can alert owners via text message or email when their pet escapes the house and then help locate him. In addition, much like the Nike+ FuelBand for humans, Tagg has an Activity Tracking option, which can monitor your pet\u2019s activity and keep track of fitness trends. ($99.95 plus a $7.95 monthly cellular connection fee, Tagg) Since you\u2019re already tracking your pet\u2019s movements, why not also get a dog or cat\u2019s-eye view of where they\u2019re going with the DogTek Eyenimal Pet Cam. The Eyenimal is a small, clip-on digital camera, designed to attach to a standard cat or dog collar. Let\u2019s get nerdy: The camera includes a CMOS sensor with automatic light adjustment, a built-in microphone, 640 x 480 image resolution and image capture at 29 frames per second. Weighing 1.2 ounces, about half of the weight of a deck of cards, the camera comes with 4GB of memory, giving you about two and a half hours of video.

If that sounds like a pitch from your local gym, you\u2019re not far off, except this time, your dog is the client. PetZen DogTread is a company that makes dog-sized treadmills to help Coco or Duke shed some extra weight and expel energy. It comes in three different sizes, for small, medium and large dogs. This is not a human-sized treadmill made smaller. Krista Wickens, co-owner of PetZen Products, said her company worked with pet behaviorists, trainers and veterinarians for two years to develop a fitness treadmill for dogs. It can also be used to help with training; you can walk beside or in front of your dog in a controlled environment before heading outside. \u201cWe looked at how a dog moved and how it thinks,\u201d Wickens said. \u201cWe also made [the DogTread] whisper quiet so it doesn\u2019t have the vibration of a human treadmill.\u201d Ideal for apartment dwellers and elderly owners, the DogTread tracks the dog\u2019s speed and progress over time. Wickens said the DogTread doesn\u2019t offer a \u201cleash binding mechanism\u201d on purpose, so \u201cpeople can\u2019t tie their dog to the machine and walk out.\u201d \u201cThe reason we sell these treadmills is for people who don\u2019t have the space to exercise their dogs as they need to,\u201d she said. \u201cMovement is the key to a better-behaved dog.\u201d (starting at $599, PetZen Products and DogTread.com) BONUS: For equine lovers who really love to splurge, the HydroHorse would make the Neiman Marcus Fantasy Gift catalog blush. It\u2019s an underwater treadmill system for horses that can be heated or chilled, and ranges in price from $60,000 to $85,000. Dart Automatic Pet Laser Toy The Dart is an automatic 360-degree rotating laser light with various speeds and time settings to produce 16 different play combinations. The timer shuts it off automatically after 10, 15 or 20 minutes. When placed on a flat surface, such as a table or the floor, the Dart promises oodles of hilarity as you watch your cat or dog chase the light around the room, but it\u2019s also exercise for those chubby pets. Word of advice: Consider removing anything breakable before setting up shop. ($29.99, ThinkGeek) If your pet lover\u2019s pup has more energy than a kindergartener on sugar cookies, then this product might be for them. GoDogGo\u2019s remote-controlled automatic ball launcher for dogs has three launch settings, which can be used in various spaces from a backyard to a baseball field. It can send a ball 12 to 42 feet, depending on the ball type and size, at 7- to 15-second intervals. According to their website, a standard tennis ball can be launched between 30 to 35 feet, while a racquet ball can go over 40 feet. Perhaps a good gift for elderly dog owners or those with shoulder issues. ($137.99, GoDogGo) Sorry, squeaky toys, but you don\u2019t hold a candle to a remote-controlled woodchuck. Made of lightweight, durable hard plastic, Go-Go Dog Pals are remote-controlled dog toys designed to look like squirrels, rabbits, turtles, porcupines, or, yes, woodchucks. Think of it as upping the ante on a game of fetch.

When these winds blow over mountains, they remove snow and ice, allowing ancient ice to come to the surface.\nA lot of Antarctic research involves deep ice core drilling to study years of climate history.\nIn this study, the researchers used what they called \u201chorizontal ice core\u201d analysis, which involved simply walking across the valley towards the mountain.\n\u201cAs you walk towards the mountain, you walk over increasingly older ice,\u201d Turney said.\nThey used some shallow drilling to take ice samples from the surface. Through isotope measurements, they found a gap in the ice sheet record immediately prior to the last interglacial.\nTurney said this gap coincided with an extreme rise in sea level and suggested a period in which there was no ice accumulating in that valley.\n\u201cIt means that a large part of the west Antarctic almost certainly disappeared in the last interglacial. It melted. It flowed rapidly into the ocean,\u201d he said.\nHe said the research also suggested this mass melting happened quite early during the ocean warming \u201csomewhere between zero and 2C\u201d.\nCountries have signed on to the Paris agreement which aims to keep global heating below 2C.\nTurney said the current summer in Australia alone had shown the dangers of a warming world just at 1C.\nHe said the team\u2019s research could be used to focus on which sections of West Antarctica are most vulnerable to the current climate crisis.\n\u201cWhat these results suggest, or show, is that when people talk about a 2C warmer world as a good thing, actually what it shows is we don\u2019t want to get close to 2C,\u201d he said.", "label": 0}, "dev-35": {"text": "No Matter How Much Tom Steyer Spends, Florida Isn\u2019t Buying Climate Disaster\nThe legendary bank robber Willie Sutton apparently did not say that he robbed banks \u201cbecause that\u2019s where the money is,\u201d even though everyone thinks he did. And, apparently, rich donors also don\u2019t identify issues that are \u201cwhere the voters are,\u201d at least in Florida.\nBillionaire Tom Steyer has spent $12 million trying to make Floridians scared of global warming \u2014 an issue Gallup recently found ranks dead last among voter priorities. Other research indicates that the more people are harangued about it, the more they turn off, making this money not well spent.\nBlame the information age, where people can easily see for themselves that we are in our 18th\u00a0year without a\u00a0global\u2010\u200bwarming trend. They can also go the National Climatic Data Center\u2019s website and plot out Florida\u2019s yearly temperature; there is no overall significant warming trend in the entire record, which covers 118\u00a0years.\n\nA little advance work could have saved a\u00a0ton of money. The most popular climate change website in the world, Anthony Watts\u2019s\u00a0www\u200b.wattsup\u200bwith\u200bthat\u200b.com, now has well over 200 million views. It is decidedly nonapocalyptic.

While some of Steyer\u2019s ads blame the Koch Brothers for skepticism about the end of the world, Watts has never seen a\u00a0dollar of their support \u2014 or, for that matter, many dollars of anyone\u2019s support, as it is mostly run with a\u00a0tip jar.\nHere\u2019s the cool part: According to the\u00a0model\u00a0the Environmental Protection Agency uses to assess the climatic effects of various policies, if the emissions from the entire state of Florida dropped immediately to zero, the amount of global warming that would be saved by the year 2100 would be a\u00a0grand total of seven thousandths of a\u00a0degree Celsius (0.007\u00b0C). Such action would cost the Florida economy a\u00a0fortune \u2014 even more money down the climate rat hole.\nAnd thanks in no small part to the nearly two decades without any warming, it looks as though the amount the EPA assumes will occur this century\u00a0was\u00a0substantially exaggerated.\nSome of Steyer\u2019s ad footage clearly conflates warming and tidal inundations caused by hurricane winds. The fact is a\u00a0lot of people in Florida don\u2019t remember the last big (Category 3\u00a0or higher) one, Hurricane Wilma, which made landfall in Florida on Oct. 24, 2005. In fact, Wilma was the last such Category 3\u00a0to strike in the entire U.S., 3,292\u00a0days ago. This is the longest that the country has gone without such a\u00a0storm since the Civil War era, and\u00a023\u00a0days from now, we will be in the longest major hurricane drought in our recorded history.\nThe truth of the matter is, the planet is warmer than it was, and there\u2019s some evidence that people have something to do with it. It just doesn\u2019t have anything to do with hurricanes and their brethren around the entire planet, nor is it strong enough to even induce a\u00a0significant warming trend in the overall Florida record.\nIncidentally, the hallmark of warming from carbon dioxide (recent years notwithstanding)\u00a0is that the coldest air masses of the winter are what warm the most. These are what freeze Florida\u2019s orange crop. One notorious 1977 freeze, dubbed The Siberian Express, actually put down snow in Miami, for the first and only time since good weather records have been kept.\nAs Casey Stengel would have said, \u201cyou could look it up,\u201d which is precisely what people do when hectored about the upcoming climate apocalypse. People my age have lived through about nine such apocalypses. \u201cAcid rain\u201d seems so quaint now, doesn\u2019t it?\nThe reason voters rank global warming dead last is because they are tired of these false apocalypses. They\u00a0are suffering from apocalypse fatigue, something well\u2010\u200bheeled political donors would do well to recognize. Throwing money at exaggerated disasters may cost more votes than it buys.", "label": 1}, "dev-36": {"text": "The Coalition wants to turn scientists into lapdogs \u2013 and muzzle climate research in the process\nPolicies matter. Good policies lead to good outcomes, while bad policies can lead to disaster. But what about where there is no policy, or a policy that is incohesive and incomplete? We only need to look at the state of science research policy in Australia to find out.\nScientific research in Australia has always suffered from political influence, because research in Australia is heavily dependent on federal government funding. But political interference in scientific research has been weaponised during the past decade of Coalition governments.\nThe most obvious and destructive manifestation of this political interference on the nation\u2019s scientific research effort is the lack of a comprehensive science policy. It can be argued that some consequences of this meddling in the research effort have been this summer\u2019s bushfire emergency and the widespread environmental destruction, mostly initiated via climate change.\nThe scientific community and the whole of rational Australia were stunned by the decision of the Abbott government not to appoint a minister for science in 2013. This was coincident with the defunding of research into climate change and the environment. There was no science policy put forward by the Abbott government.\nThe Turnbull government did go some way to redress this lack of policy through the national innovation and science agenda in 2015, which promised to set \u201ca focus on science, research and innovation as long-term drivers of economic prosperity, jobs and growth\u201d. What they came up with was Australia\u2019s national science statement in 2017 which, in turn, gave Australia a grab bag of science policies, programs and projects. This is the closest the Coalition government has come to providing a science policy.\nBut this is not a science policy in either scope or execution. It\u2019s a political agenda favouring a few scientific research programs that resonate with the government\u2019s economic agenda. There is a strong emphasis on projects that may provide an economic return in the near future and there is no scope for funding research into areas that the government does not favour. This political agenda has been carefully crafted to make it look like the government is supporting scientific research, while in reality it neither understands what science has to offer or has the desire to fund any more research than it has to.\nThe centrepiece of the current government\u2019s science agenda is its statement on science, technology, engineering and mathematics (Stem). It is quite clear that this agenda is closely linked to economic outcomes and returns. This reduces the Australian scientific research effort to a cookie jar of favoured projects that can make a financial return for the canny investor. It turns Australia\u2019s scientists into the lapdogs of industry.\nPerhaps the saddest part of this political game is that the favoured issues and projects do genuinely deserve support and funding but they have been turned into sock-puppets aimed at distracting public attention from areas of research that have been excluded from such support. Issues such as advancing women in Stem and research into emerging technologies such as nanotechnology, robotics, quantum computing and space industries are all worthy of public money, but so too are issues of climate and environmental research.\nNot that Coalition governments are all that interested in research anyway. In 2018 research funding for Australian universities was cut to the lowest levels in 40 years. In that year our research effort plunged well below the OECD average. A minor bounce in the 2019 budget for research funding has not redressed this loss. If we are to judge this government by its actions, it is not interested in research and never has been.\nIt is not hard to see why the current and former Coalition governments want to play favourites with scientific research. There has been a consistent theme of climate denial and environmental inaction from the federal government since 2013. All the while there has been a clarion call for action on climate and environmental issues led by scientists working in those areas. Seemingly immune to facts and reason (one Coalition MP recently vowed not to let his opinions be informed by evidence), why would you want to fund the nagging voice of science? No need to shoot the messenger when you can simply starve them to death.\nSo what have been the consequences of this lack of a proper science policy for Australia? The weakened voice of our climate and environmental research scientists has been easier to ignore. With minimal monitoring and reporting on the environment and next to no effective research into the effects of climate change in Australia, the early troubling signs of the unfolding catastrophes were largely unobserved and unreported. We drifted into the unprecedented drought, the drying of the Murray-Darling, the catastrophic bushfires and the ferocious flooding events, untroubled by any warnings from a research community that had been effectively silenced.\nA wise government would have a broad-based science policy backed up by funding support that is at least on par with the world average. Since we have neither of these, we can only question the wisdom of the current federal government.\n\u2022 Associate Professor Paul Willis is adjunct in palaeontology at Flinders University.

Both of these datasets were subject to the same smoothing as the model predictions.\n\nIn his congressional testimony, Christy really didn\u2019t have time to explain the larger significance of his finding, which is that it sends the forecasts into the recycling bin.\nRain and snow are principally dependent upon the temperature difference between the surface and the mid\u2010\u200btroposphere. When there\u2019s little difference, the air is said to be \u201cstable,\u201d meaning the vertical movement that\u2019s required to form a\u00a0cloud is inhibited. Think thunderheads on a\u00a0hot day. When the difference is large, explosive storms develop.\nGetting this difference wrong mean getting rainfall wrong, which means subsequent forecasts of surface temperature, including daily highs and lows are also wrong. A\u00a0moist surface warms much more slowly than a\u00a0dry one (been to the desert recently?). Similarly, wet surfaces cool more slowly at night. If the models somehow got these correct, it would either by dumb luck or with some sort of adjustment (known in freshman chemistry as \u201cfudging\u201d to get the right answer).\nIndeed, the failure in the mid\u2010\u200btroposphere is one of the major reasons that the models also are having so much trouble with the surface temperature forecast.\nSpeaking of those temperatures, they\u2019re a\u00a0bit slipperier than the mid\u2010\u200btropospheric ones. The laboratories responsible for the three principal versions of surface temperature history keep changing them, much more frequently than the satellite or the weather balloon data are reconfigured.\nWhen we examined the surface temperature behavior in a\u00a0presentation to the American Geophysical Union last fall, we used the one from the Climate Research Unit at the University of East Anglia because it provides the closest match to the mid\u2010\u200btropospheric satellite data, compared to the other two histories, from NASA and the Department of Commerce.\nOur results made the models look very bad. Since then, the CRU revised history by warming up recent years, so if we run our experiment now the models merely look bad.\nIt\u2019s mind\u2010\u200bboggling that our leaders continue to cling to these failed models as the Paris summit stumbles to its predictable conclusion, which will be a\u00a0lukewarm, unenforceable agreement, perhaps fitting for an atmosphere that is similarly lukewarming.", "label": 1}, "dev-38": {"text": "Extinction Rebellion: Its Never Been About the Climate\nRule 11 \u2013 The price of a successful attack is a constructive alternative.\nOne thing about us wiseguys, the hustle never ends.\nIt\u2019s fair to say that we\u2019ve always known groups like Extinction Rebellion aren\u2019t really about climate change. This article by founding member Stuart Basden, confirms that XR is just another Marxist organisation following Saul Alinksky\u2019s Rules for Radicals playbook.\nYes, yes, I know. The climate is breaking down. It\u2019s urgent. An emergency. We\u2019ve only got a few years left to \u2018fix\u2019 it.\n[..,]I\u2019ve been with Extinction Rebellion (XR) from the start. I was one of the 15 people in April 2018 who came together and made the collective decision to try to create the conditions that would initiate a rebellion. I was a coordinator of one of the original five working groups, and I\u2019ve been organising with XR day-and-night since then (frugally living off my savings so I don\u2019t have to work, having quit an industry that paid me \u00a31000/week). And I\u2019ve been in RisingUp (the organisation from which XR has emerged) since the first RisingUp action in November 2016. I\u2019m a RisingUp Holding Group member, and a member of the XR Guardianship Team.\n[\u2026{And I\u2019m here to say that XR isn\u2019t about the climate. You see, the climate\u2019s breakdown is a symptom of a toxic system of that has infected the ways we relate to each other as humans and to all life. This was exacerbated when European \u2018civilisation\u2019 was spread around the globe through cruelty and violence (especially) over the last 600 years of colonialism, although the roots of the infections go much further back.  As Europeans spread their toxicity around the world, they brought torture, genocide, carnage and suffering to the ends of the earth. Their cultural myths justified the horrors, such as the idea that indigenous people were animals (not humans), and therefore God had given us dominion over them. This was used to justify a multi-continent-wide genocide of tens of millions of people. The coming of the scientific era saw this intensify, as the world around us was increasingly seen as \u2018dead\u2019 matter \u2014 just sitting there waiting for us to exploit it and use it up. We\u2019re now using it up faster than ever.\nBlah blah blah. But don\u2019t worry. It gets worse.\nEuro-Americans violently imposed and taught dangerous delusions that they used to justify the exploitation and reinforced our dominance, while silencing worldviews that differed or challenged them. The UK\u2019s hand in this was enormous, as can be seen by the size of the former British empire, and the dominance of the English language around the world. There is stark evidence that everyday racial bias continues in Britain, now, today. It\u2019s worth naming some of these constructed delusions that have been coded into societies and institutions around the world: The delusion of white-supremacy centres whiteness and the experience of white people, constructing and perpetuating the myth that white people and their lives are somehow inherently better and more valuable than people of colour. The delusion of patriarchy centres the male experience, and excludes/hinders female assigned people from public life (reducing them to a possession or object for ownership or consumption). Patriarchy teaches dominating and competitive behaviours, and emphasises the idea that the world is a place of scarcity, separation and powerlessness. The delusions of Eurocentrism include the notion that Europeans know what is best for the world. The delusions of hetero-sexism/heteronormativity propagate the idea that heterosexuality is \u2018normal\u2019 and that other expressions of sexuality are deviant. The delusions of class hierarchy uphold the theory that the rich elite are better/smarter/nobler than the rest of us, and make therefore better decisions.\nThe guy is obviously a complete nut job but here\u2019s the most important bit:\n[\u2026]So Extinction Rebellion isn\u2019t about the climate. It\u2019s not even about \u2018climate justice\u2019**, although that is also important. If we only talk about the climate, we\u2019re missing the deeper problems plaguing our culture. And if we don\u2019t excise the cause of the infection, we can never hope to heal from it.\nI don\u2019t know if this twat has read rule 11 of Alinsky\u2019s Rules for Radicals but he certainly gets it.\u00a0Imagine that XR get its way. What happens then? Will they all go home? Of course not. Make no mistake, XR is about shaking down Capitalism.\nThis article is calling to all of those who are involved in XR who sometimes slip into saying it\u2019s a climate movement. It\u2019s a call to the American rebels who made a banner saying \u201cCLIMATE extinction rebellion\u201d. It\u2019s a call to the XR Media & Messaging teams to never get sloppy with the messaging and \u2018reduce\u2019 it to climate issues. It\u2019s a call to the XR community to never say we\u2019re a climate movement. Because we\u2019re not. We\u2019re a Rebellion.

But this not the same thing as saying climate change, and especially man-made climate change, is the root cause of the fires.\nSpring rainfall has declined in recent decades, even as temperatures rise, extreme heat events become more common, and droughts turn more severe, according to a 2018 report by Australia\u2019s Bureau of Meteorology. Those forces have contributed to a greater number of days with \u201cvery high fire dangers,\u201d and helped extend the fire season into spring.\n[\u2026] Ignoring the dangers: Australians in fire-ravaged regions angrily criticized Prime Minister Scott Morrison for downplaying the dangers of climate change, and failing to act on repeated recommendations to bolster the nation\u2019s defenses against wildfires and other disasters.

While the climate is indeed changing and human activity is playing a role, the chances of looming climate catastrophe are simply unrealistic and not grounded in reality.\n\nBut even granting such a looming catastrophe, the Paris Agreement itself would do little to alter the climate. To have any impact whatsoever on climate, the entire world would either have to quickly change the way it consumes energy or simply remain undeveloped. Both options are devoid of reality.\n\nWhile many countries are rapidly expanding their use of renewable power, forecasts indicate that coal, oil, and natural gas will continue to provide the overwhelming majority of the world\u2019s energy needs well into the future. For developing countries, the highest priorities are to reduce energy poverty and improve living standards.\n\nThose who are clamoring for action on climate change are the ones who should actually be most upset with what a sham the Paris agreement is. It\u2019s been celebrated as a breakthrough achievement of the world\u2019s developed and developing countries coming together, but it is anything but that.\n\n>>>The Right Way to Ensure a Cleaner Environment\n\nWith no enforcement mechanisms in place and no repercussions for failing to meet emissions reduction targets, countries are essentially free to do whatever they want, meaning they will continue on their business-as-usual trajectory without making any changes. China, for instance, can peak its emissions in 2030 even though projections have their peak emissions falling before that year.\n\nIndia, for its part, has pledged to reduce its emissions levels, or cuts its ratio of carbon emissions to gross domestic product. That ratio may well go down so long as carbon emissions rise at a slower rate than GDP, but carbon emissions will keep rising all the same. \n\nActually, India committed to emissions reductions that are less than what the country would achieve if it continues on the same track it is currently on today. In other words, it set the bar so low that it can continue along its businesses-as-usual trajectory of emissions intensity and come out looking like a climate hero.\n\nAs the Manhattan Institute\u2019s Oren Cass wrote, \u201cIt\u2019s easy to slim down to 180 pounds, if you weigh 175 to begin with.\u201d\n\nPakistan was more honest than most about its emissions prospects, stating bluntly, \u201cGiven the future economic growth and associated growth in the energy sector, the peaking of emissions in Pakistan is expected to take place much beyond the year 2030. An exponential increase of [greenhouse gas] emissions for many decades is likely to occur before any decrease in emissions can be expected.\u201d\n\nGlobal compliance with the Paris Agreement has been nothing short of abysmal. In fact, most nations will soon fail to meet the deadlines they agreed to.\n\nThe original hope that each nation\u2019s contribution might somehow push other countries to \u201cdo more\u201d is not playing out. This deal was a hodgepodge of arbitrarily defined commitments with no enforcement mechanism. It was doomed from the start.\n\nFollowing through with the Obama administration\u2019s commitments would impose clear economic harm on the U.S. by driving energy prices higher\u2014and that\u2019s just a small part of the overall cost. Americans would pay more for food, health care, education, clothes, and every other good and service that requires energy.\n\nThese higher costs would be spread across the entire economy and would shrink overall economic growth and employment. Heritage Foundation analysts estimated that the regulations required to meet the Obama administration\u2019s commitments would impose the following costs by 2035:\n\nAn overall loss of nearly 400,000 jobs, half of which would be in manufacturing.\nA average total income loss of more than $20,000 for a family of four.\nAn aggregate GDP loss of over $2.5 trillion.\nOther countries would continue getting a free pass under the agreement, but if the U.S. signed back on, one can be sure that environmental activist lawsuits would make sure the U.S. kept its obligations. \n\nTo make matters worse, the climate regulations encompassing the U.S. target may not even achieve the desired results and would require additional regulations. And that would just be the beginning. The Paris Agreement requires ever-increasing targets as time goes on, which would further increase the cost of compliance. These efforts would return us to the same costly and ineffective policies that the current administration is unwinding.\n\nCongress should instead advance pragmatic policies that will actually drive innovation in energy and environmental protection.", "label": 1}, "dev-44": {"text": "Climate Change: Obama Is Making Promises He Can\u2019t Keep\nOn April 22, Earth Day, leaders from countries around the world will attend a\u00a0grand signing ceremony at the United Nations, officially reaffirming the greenhouse gas reduction pledges they made at last December\u2019s U.N. climate conference in Paris.\nInstead of rushing to reaffirm that pledge, President Obama should be working to rescind it.\nUnder the Paris Agreement, most major greenhouse gas\u2010\u200bemitting countries offered rather timid emissions targets that aligned with existing projections. In contrast, President Obama\u00a0pledged\u00a0an aggressive goal of reducing U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by 26 to 28 percent below 2005 levels by the year 2025.\n\nThat is a\u00a0promise he cannot keep.\nIndeed, in the time since President Obama rallied international support at the Paris conference by extolling the U.S. leadership role in addressing climate change, a\u00a0confluence of reality checks has revealed much of what he said to have been a\u00a0grand illusion.\nFor starters, less than two months after the president told the delegates that \u201cwe\u2019ve said yes to the first\u2010\u200bever set of national standards limiting the amount of carbon pollution our power plants can release into the sky,\u201d the Supreme Court said \u201cnot so fast.\u201d By issuing a\u00a0stay on the\u00a0EPA\u2019s Clean Power Plan, the Court signaled its concern that the central pillar of Obama\u2019s plan to achieve his promised emissions reduction may not be altogether legal.\nThe Court\u2019s ultimate decision likely rests with the November election and the subsequent justice appointment. This is expected to delay the implementation of the Clean Power Plan by several years, if not overturn it completely.\nEither outcome will be a\u00a0major blow to the timetable for Obama\u2019s promised emissions reductions. And no one is claiming that the promised target can be achieved without the Clean Power Plan (and then some).\nTo make matters worse, the EPA has\u00a0increased\u00a0its estimate of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions and decreased its estimate of recent emissions decline. This not only takes the shine off of Obama\u2019s claim in Paris that \u201cover the last seven years, we\u2019ve made\u2026ambitious reductions in our carbon emissions,\u201d but it also means the road to the president\u2019s target just got a\u00a0lot steeper.\nThe EPA\u2019s new numbers come in light of\u00a0evidence\u00a0that methane emissions\u2014a greenhouse gas some 25 times stronger than carbon dioxide\u2014have increased substantially over the past decade rather than declining as the EPA has previously reported.\nThe source of this increase has not been definitely identified, although oil and natural gas recovery operations are in the crosshairs. But no matter the source, growing methane emissions further jeopardizes Obama\u2019s emissions reduction timeline.\nAnd in a\u00a0last ditch effort to make the situation seem rosier than it really is, a\u00a0new\u00a0report\u00a0from the State Department employs a\u00a0bit of creative accounting that\u00a0invokes\u00a0a\u00a0large increase in the amount of carbon dioxide that it expects U.S. forests to uptake over the next decade.\nThe more carbon dioxide the Administration assumes to be taken out of the atmosphere by forests and other plants\u2014after all, carbon dioxide is a\u00a0plant fertilizer\u2014the fewer the reductions in actual emissions have to be to hit the target.\nThe \u201coptimistic\u201d outlook from the State Department relies on incentivized land\u2010\u200buse changes to increase the carbon sink by some 25 percent over the next 10\u00a0years. According to EPA numbers, over the past five years the size of the US carbon sink hasn\u2019t changed at all.\nAll of this \u2014the stayed Clean Power Plan, growing methane emissions, and overly optimistic projections\u2014undermine the viability of Obama\u2019s pledge. Add to the mix energy efficiency measures which don\u2019t work as well as advertised, low gas prices and a\u00a0growing economy that is still tightly linked to fossil fuels, and you arrive at the unimpeachable conclusion that we are not going to come close to meeting the emissions pledges made by the president.\nEven the recently extended green subsidies for wind and solar, which may slow the bleeding in the short term, come up far short in producing the greenhouse gas emissions reduction necessary to reach our target by 2025.\nThe one pledge under the agreement that the president has managed to keep alive is his promise to fund the international\u00a0Green Climate Fund\u00a0to the tune of $2.5 billion. He made the first $500 million installment just last month.\nThis payout may appease some countries enough to keep them from walking away from the agreement citing U.S. hypocrisy, but it shouldn\u2019t appease us here at home, where the money comes from.\nPutting our name on an international agreement we all know is a\u00a0sham doesn\u2019t bolster efforts to curb climate change. Rather, it casts them as disingenuous. This is something that we should not have to pay for, now, or in the future.\nIt\u2019s high time to walk back our Paris promise.", "label": 1}, "dev-45": {"text": "A Top Gun fantasy that came true\nIt was the summer of 1997 and American Sharon Besser, a grad student at UC Berkley near San Francisco, found herself on the other side of the world in Papua New Guinea. She\u2019d arrived there via Earth Watch, an organization that connects volunteers with scientists in need of assistance, and she planned to spend the next several weeks in the coastal town of Madang, diving the waters of the Pacific to help study the region\u2019s barracuda population. After a few weeks of backpacking around the country, she boarded a plane in Hoskins, on the island of New Britain, to take her to her post. Australian Jeremy Howell was in the pilot\u2019s seat. Have you ever met someone special while travelling? Tell us about it and your story could be featured in BBC Travel\u2019s How We Met series! \u201cThe plane was a small, 20-seater turbo prop,\u201d Jeremy remembered. It was usually operated by two pilots, but this time Jeremy was flying solo. \u201cI stayed at the controls in the cockpit as the passengers boarded.\u201d When Sharon came up the stairs, he turned to the cabin and smoothly offered \u201cWould you like the front seat? The view is better up here.\u201d \u201cIt was a little like a Top Gun fantasy,\u201d Sharon said as she remembered taking the co-pilot\u2019s seat. \u201cHe had on a white uniform and aviators and so of course I wanted to sit up front.\u201d The duo chatted on the flight, and Jeremy discovered that Sharon would be staying at Jais Aben Resort, a spot he frequently went with his friends. He asked to meet her at the bar that night. \u201cI had to fight off a couple other pilots,\u201d he laughed. \u201cWe didn\u2019t get too many single ladies visiting Madang.\u201d Jeremy and Sharon saw each other several times during the next few weeks, but remained friends despite Jeremy doing his best to impress her. \u201cI\u2019d organized a day out for us with two of my co-workers who owned a boat,\u201d Jeremy said. \u201cIt sounded like fun, but the guys swore like troopers and their jokes were no better. After an hour or two, Sharon was saying that she had a headache and I\u2019m thinking, \u2018Yeah, I would too.\u2019\u201d When they got back on dry land however, it quickly became apparent that Sharon was seriously ill. \u201c[When] we got home she went straight to bed and I started to realize something was wrong,\u201d Jeremy said. \u201cThere are only three doctors in town, so I drove around for an hour or so before I could find one.\u201d Sharon was so weak by the time Jeremy returned that he had to carry her to the car. The doctor diagnosed Sharon with malaria. \u201cI\u2019d planned to keep travelling but couldn\u2019t go on because I was sick,\u201d Sharon remembered. \u201cBut now we had this extra time together \u2013 five days we wouldn\u2019t have had otherwise. He was so sweet taking care of me and at some point, things got romantic.\u201d Unfortunately, once she got better, Sharon\u2019s time in Papua New Guinea was up, and it was time for her to fly back to the US to return to school. \u201cWe\u2019d developed quite a bond. She left a little teary and we agreed to keep in touch,\u201d Jeremy said. Nine months passed, and during that time the pair exchanged letters recounting their daily lives. \u201cHe had no email or phone really,\u201d Sharon said. \u201cI just had a black-and-white photo of him on my fridge, and every couple of months I\u2019d get a letter and write one back. He was a great letter writer, very romantic. It was a refreshing way to get to know someone, writing about the details of your lives, even the mundane things. I still have them all in a file.\u201d Summer was on its way again, and Sharon would have another stretch of time off. \u201cSo I wrote him a letter asking if he would want to meet me somewhere to travel around together. It was a risk, this letter, but I wanted to see where we might go next with our relationship.\u201d It arrived with fortuitous timing. \u201cI got a call from him, which was weird because I hadn\u2019t ever talked to him on the phone,\u201d Sharon said. \u201cHe had gotten the letter literally on the day he was leaving the country. He told me about a new job in South Australia and asked if I could come there. And that\u2019s when our relationship really started,\u201d Sharon said. Over the next two years, the couple saw each other during a series of visits, still residing on opposite sides of the Pacific until Jeremy moved to the UK in late 1999 where Sharon planned to join him after graduation. \u201cWe always talk about there being three ways of doing something: his way, my way and the third way,\u201d Sharon said. \u201cThe move to England was like that \u2014 I didn\u2019t want to move to Australia and he didn\u2019t want to come to California, so that was the middle, the third way.\u201d Jeremy proposed the next summer, while visiting with Sharon at her family\u2019s lake house on New Hampshire\u2019s Lake Winnipesaukee. They were later married there in 2001. They later had two children, and the family recently settled in Madison, Wisconsin, although Jeremy still flies for a company based in Hong Kong, where the couple lived for 10 years after they moved from the UK. \u201cLots of people think it\u2019s weird that he commutes to Hong Kong, but we had this history that makes us able to cope with distance,\u201d Sharon said.

If the men in orange inevitably take the plaudits, a silvery fox on the touchlines played a key part. Bert van Marwijk\u2019s decision to withdraw a holding midfielder, Demy De Zeeuw, and send on the more attack-minded Rafael van der Vaart for the second half set Uruguay a challenge too far. In the end, it didn\u2019t really matter that it never felt quite like a World Cup semi-final, although Fifa should have offered the blocks of empty seats to local children, giving them a memory for life. For last night was about Dutch memories. For now the Dutch can slay the ghosts that haunt their sleep, that keep alive those painful images of Paul Breitner and Gerd Muller punishing their complacency in Munich in 1974. Or the distressing memory of Mario Kempes striking amidst the tickertape in Buenos Aires four years later. That wonderful Dutch generation twice failed at the last. A lesser collection of individual players now hopes to end that wait, overcoming either Germany or Spain in Soccer City. If Van Marwijk\u2019s tactical tweak was vital last night, a change he made in the mood of the team was even more important. Sneijder, Robben, Van der Vaart and Robin van Persie would not make a good relay team because each would want to keep the baton. Van Marwijk has ended that selfish mentality, making each think of the wider good. Such unity was captured after every goal, when those on the pitch celebrated with those on the bench. They are committed to each other and to victory. ''We cultivated this mentality,\u2019\u2019 said Van Marwijk. ''We have banished complacency. Today, I just said to them: \u2018Don\u2019t let this chance slip away.\u2019 They didn\u2019t. I love attacking, beautiful football but you have to start with the players doing their defensive jobs and in the right positions. ''We played a wonderful game against Germany in 1974 but we lost when we should have won. We played well and we had a unique generation. Johan Cruyff was the best footballer I ever saw. We are (now) strong as a \u2018team\u2019, and I want to stress the word \u2018team\u2019.\u2019\u2019 He will watch intently this evening\u2019s second semi-final. ''Spain are playing the best football in the world, but Germany have been the best team at this championships. We\u2019ll take either of them. It\u2019ll be an interesting match. It would be unique to play Germany in the final, as it was in 1974.\u2019\u2019 How the Dutch fans would love that. Dressed as if heading out on the ultimate hen party, Holland\u2019s magnificent supporters had begun partying long before kick-off, turning the Waterfront area into a sea of orange. Some were dressed as cow-girls, others had plastic edam cheeses on their heads and most came armed with orange vuvuzelas. Even at half-time when Uruguay had just equalised, the Dutch fans kept the faith. The first half had been a tale of two captains, of Diego Forlan but first Van Bronckhorst. In setting the stage for the opening goal, Mark van Bommel went in hard, nastily hard, and Walter Gargano faltered at the sight of the Dutchman\u2019s studs. Gargano pulled out of the tackle, although he still had to withstand the force of Van Bommel\u2019s challenge. Uruguay endured further pain. The ball was now under Dutch sway, De Zeeuw exchanging passes with Sneijder before transferring the ball to Van Bronckhorst, whose left-footed strike touched 61mph as it covered the 41 yards past Fernando Muslera. Not even Luis Suarez could have kept it out. Suarez\u2019s absence had brought in Edinson Cavani, forcing Forlan to work higher up the pitch but four minutes from the break he dropped deep to devastating effect. Collecting possession 30 yards out, his blonde tresses flowing behind him, Forlan cut inside and brought his left foot down into the ball. Maarten Stekelenburg has been one of the keepers of this World Cup but he erred badly here. Sticking out a left hand far from convincingly, the Ajax keeper failed to prevent the ball flying into the net. Maybe he can get some lessons from Suarez back in Amsterdam. As the vanquished keeper beseeched the heaven for answers, Forlan sprinted to one group of Uruguay supporters. ''Three Million Dreams\u2019\u2019 read one banner. Uruguay\u2019s tiny population were daring to dream. Not for long. Van Marwijk gambled, altering his midfield. For all the fear of leaving the back-door open, Holland were fully committed to attack, wonderfully so. By now the Dutch vuvuzelas were blowing a gale, hitting hurricane force with 20 minutes remaining. Sneijder\u2019s shot had a few stops en route into Uruguay\u2019s net, notably off Maxi Pereira, but it was undoubtedly deserved. Van Marwijk\u2019s insistence that his players keep turning the screw, rather than showboating, was again seen when Dirk Kuyt lifted in a cross. Twisting his body, Robben met the ball brilliantly, heading it powerfully past Muslera. Doubts briefly swamped Dutch minds when Maxi Pereira slid in a low left-footed but Van Marwijk\u2019s history men held on and the party really started.

In a televised address to the nation, Obama defended the legality of his actions and challenged Republican lawmakers to focus their energy not on blocking his actions but on approving long-stalled legislation to take its place. U.S. Speaker of the House John Boehner pledged Friday morning to fight Obama's plan, telling reporters the president had \"turned a deaf ear\" to the electorate and \"deliberately sabotaged\" efforts at bipartisan immigration reform. Boehner said the reforms would encourage more people to come to the U.S. illegally. Separately, House Republicans sued the Obama administration on Friday over its implementation of the president's health-care law, claiming he had overstepped his authority. The administration is also setting new immigration enforcement priorities that could make it easier for many more people in the U.S. illegally to stay in the country. U.S. Speaker of the House John Boehner pledged Friday morning to fight Obama's plan, telling reporters the president had and 'deliberately sabotaged' efforts at bipartisan immigration reform. (Larry Downing/Reuters) \"There are actions I have the legal authority to take as president \u2014 the same kinds of actions taken by Democratic and Republican presidents before me \u2014 that will help make our immigration system more fair and more just,\" Obama said. Obama said deportations of criminals are up 80 per cent and that the government will keep focusing enforcement resources on actual threats to the U.S. \"Felons, not families. Criminals, not children. Gang members, not a mom who\u2019s working hard to provide for her kids. We\u2019ll prioritize, just like law enforcement does every day. The president said that tracking down, rounding up and deporting millions of people isn\u2019t realistic. Obama offered temporary residence for those who have been in the U.S. for more than five years, or have children who are American citizens or legal residents. \"If you register, pass a criminal background check, and you're willing to pay your fair share of taxes \u2014 you\u2019ll be able to apply to stay in this country temporarily, without fear of deportation. You can come out of the shadows and get right with the law.\" Obama insisted that his actions did not amount to amnesty. \"Amnesty is the immigration system we have today \u2014 millions of people who live here without paying their taxes or playing by the rules, while politicians use the issue to scare people and whip up votes at election time,\" he said However, the plan would leave the fate of millions more unresolved. With more than 11 million immigrants living in the country illegally, Obama's actions would not offer specific protections to more than half. President Barack Obama unveiled expansive executive actions on immigration Thursday night to spare nearly five million people in the U.S. illegally from deportation. (Jim Bourg/Associated Press) But the vehement reactions of Republicans, who will have control of Congress come January, made clear that Obama was courting a serious partisan confrontation. Boehner, who has refused to have his Republican members vote on broad immigration legislation passed by the Senate last year, said Obama's decision to go it alone \"cemented his legacy of lawlessness and squandered what little credibility he had left.\" None of those affected by Obama's actions would have a direct path to citizenship, and his actions could be reversed by a new president after he leaves office.

There is heartening news for those who choose to keep their lights on\u2014whether as part of the \u201cHuman Achievement Hour\u201d counter\u2010\u200bmovement or just as part of their everyday routine.\nThe International Energy Agency has\u00a0announced\u00a0that global energy\u2010\u200brelated carbon dioxide emissions were flat for the third year in a\u00a0row in 2016 even as the world economy grew, indicating a\u00a0sustained decoupling of emissions and economic activity. This is arguably as momentous as the\u00a0well\u2010\u200bdocumented\u00a0decoupling of agricultural land area from crop yields and the decoupling of forest area loss from growth in population.\n\nLargely responsible for flatlining emissions is a\u00a0widespread\u00a0shift from coal to cleaner\u2010\u200bburning natural gas, which has become much more cost\u2010\u200beffective thanks to the innovation of fracking, a\u00a0product of private\u2010\u200bsector competition. Other factors that may deserve some credit for that trend include advances in energy efficiency, the connection of new nuclear reactors to the grid, and better renewable energy technology. (Although it should be noted that state\u2010\u200bmandated, centrally\u2010\u200bplanned transitions from fossil fuels to green energy have resulted in numerous problems, as Germany is\u00a0finding out).\nLast year, global emissions stood still even while the world economy grew by 3.1 percent. Emissions fell in the United States and China, and remained stable in Europe. That compensated for emissions increases elsewhere in the world, as often\u2010\u200bdemonized cheap fossil fuels\u00a0helped poor countries to develop\u00a0and\u00a0expanded electricity access\u00a0to those in need.\nThe market\u2010\u200bbased fracking revolution enabled the U.S. to reduce its emissions more than any other country, and also\u00a0lowered Americans\u2019 electricity bills. The average American household now devotes less than 4\u00a0percent of its annual spending to energy.\nU.S. coal demand fell by 11 percent as natural gas became more cost\u2010\u200bcompetitive and, for the first time in history, the country generated more electricity from natural gas than from coal. Global coal demand fell as well. Even as the move from coal to shale gas decreased U.S. emissions by 3\u00a0percent, bringing U.S. emissions to their lowest level since 1992, the U.S. economy expanded by 1.6 percent.\nYet, it was not Environmental Protection Agency regulations or\u00a0costly subsidies\u00a0for unreliable wind and solar energy that brought down emissions, but rather a\u00a0technological breakthrough delivered by the market.\nEven the U.S. Energy Information Administration\u00a0acknowledges\u00a0the crucial role of fracking in reducing U.S. emissions, and the International Energy Administration agrees. Falling emissions are: \u201ca sign that market dynamics and technological improvements matter. This is especially true in the United States, where abundant shale gas supplies have become a\u00a0cheap power source,\u201d\u00a0according to\u00a0IEA Executive Director Faith Birol.\nChina, similarly, reduced its emissions by 1\u00a0percent last year while its economy grew by 6.7 percent. The country increased its nuclear capacity by a\u00a0quarter, generating power from five new nuclear reactors. This was part of a\u00a0broader global trend. In 2016, global nuclear net capacity reached its highest point since 1993. China also began shifting from coal to natural gas as the latter became cheaper, but natural gas still only supplies 6\u00a0percent of China\u2019s energy. In comparison, natural gas now supplies about a\u00a0quarter of all energy worldwide. The emissions\u2010\u200breducing potential of a\u00a0larger\u2010\u200bscale Chinese switch from coal to natural gas is considerable.\nIt is evident that market forces, rather than government mandates, have driven the decoupling of emissions and economic growth. Only the future will reveal the full potential of human ingenuity to supply humanity\u2019s needs while reducing harmful environmental impacts. In the meantime, on Saturday during \u201cEarth Hour,\u201d Americans and Chinese who choose to keep the lights on should know that the environmental impact of doing so is less than in years past.", "label": 1}, "dev-50": {"text": "In Chattanooga, a Young Man in a Downward Spiral\nCHATTANOOGA, Tenn. \u2014 The last time family members here saw Mohammod Abdulazeez was last Tuesday, but they did not worry about his absence because they thought he was heading back to the Nashville suburb where he had found steady work. He had even talked about a coming business trip. They dared to hope that he was putting his troubles behind him. They heard little more from him for two days, a family representative said, until much of the nation learned his name on Thursday when news broke that Mr. Abdulazeez, 24, had taken an assault rifle and opened fire on servicemen at two locations here. The rampage by Mr. Abdulazeez killed four people, fatally wounded a fifth and injured two others before he was killed in a gun battle with the police. As the F.B.I. sent more investigators into this city Monday to explore dozens of possible leads, a picture took shape of a deeply troubled young man who struggled with mental illness and drug abuse at the same time he found himself alienated from United States policies in the Arab world, according to the authorities, friends and the family representative. The authorities who were examining Mr. Abdulazeez\u2019s computer found that he had viewed material connected to Anwar al-Awlaki, the radical American-born cleric who was killed in Yemen by an American drone strike in 2011, according to a person with knowledge of the investigation. Mr. Abdulazeez had suffered for years from depression and possibly from bipolar disorder, the family representative said, adding that he had abused alcohol and possibly prescription painkillers and had gained and lost jobs. In his last months, he faced the prospect of both bankruptcy and jail time on a drunken-driving charge. \u201cI think he knew he was going downhill, and he intended to go downhill, but I don\u2019t think he knew where he\u2019d end up at the bottom,\u201d the representative, who insisted on anonymity to protect the family, said of Mr. Abdulazeez\u2019s final days alive. In a few pages of rambling notes being pored over by the F.B.I., Mr. Abdulazeez wrote about suicide and martyrdom as long ago as 2013, a senior United States intelligence official said. \u201cIt\u2019s probably the most we have got so far on his state of mind,\u201d said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the continuing investigation. The family representative said the notes, all more than a year old, expressed Mr. Abdulazeez\u2019s discontent with United States military action in the Middle East, and \u201ctalks about his life being worthless.\u201d They are less a diary, the representative said, than a scattershot set of observations, some of them \u201cgibberish,\u201d while others \u201cwere clearly things that were written by someone who was very depressed.\u201d \u201cThese are not the most \u2018I\u2019m going to martyr myself\u2019 sort of statements,\u201d the representative said. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty much what you\u2019d expect from a depressed person who is reading stuff about this and is like, \u2018This is a great idea.\u2019 \u201d The authorities said they were investigating what they described as a likelihood that Mr. Abdulazeez received some kind of assistance in organizing his attack, perhaps financial aid in obtaining weapons. But it remains unclear whether anyone who helped him was aware of what he intended to do, or when. \u201cAll that is what we\u2019re looking at now,\u201d the official said. On July 11, Mr. Abdulazeez stocked up on ammunition at an area Walmart. Two days later, he wrote in his blog long entries on Islam, describing the world as a prison and cautioning, \u201cDon\u2019t be fooled by your desires, this life is short and bitter and the opportunity to submit to allah may pass you by.\u201d Just hours before the shooting, he sent a text to a friend with a link to an Islamic verse saying, \u201cWhosoever shows enmity to a friend of Mine, then I have declared war against him.\u201d Yet none of his known writings indicate actual plans for an assault, or the reasoning behind it, leaving investigators still searching for a motive. Mr. Abdulazeez received a diagnosis of mental illness when he was in his early teens. He was treated with medication in high school and college, but \u201che wasn\u2019t always good about taking them,\u201d the family representative said. Law enforcement officials confirmed that they too had learned that he had serious psychological problems. He turned to drugs and alcohol, and family members tried to get him into a rehab program. Despite their fears for his future, they never thought he would become violent, the representative said. In one instance, limits on the family\u2019s insurance coverage thwarted their plan to have him go into rehab. Despite his troubles, Mr. Abdulazeez graduated in 2012 from the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga with a bachelor\u2019s degree in engineering. He was born in Kuwait, to parents who were from Jordan, but grew up in this area, and was a naturalized American citizen. After college, he was \u201ca guy who was sort of bouncing around,\u201d the representative said, at times disappearing for a few days, on a binge with friends. \u201cHe was able to get jobs, but never keep them.\u201d He went to work in 2013 at a nuclear power plant near Cleveland, but was fired within days because he failed a drug test, and eventually returned to Chattanooga. He had been served an eviction notice at an apartment he rented near Cleveland for not paying the rent. Last year, he spent seven months in Jordan, where he had relatives, a trip that remains a focus of the F.B.I.\u2019s investigation with the aid of Jordanian authorities. Investigators want to know whom he met there, and whether someone he came into contact with might have inspired the attacks, or whether daily exposure to news and conversation about the war in neighboring Syria somehow set in motion his deadly planning. A gunman opened fire at a military recruiting office at about 10:45 a.m. Thursday. A police chase ensued, and several people were killed at a naval reserve center about 30 minutes later. The intelligence official said there was still no evidence that Mr. Abdulazeez was directed or inspired by the Islamic State or any other extremist group, although the official cautioned that forensic testing of his computer and phone, which could yield crucial evidence, was not yet complete. After Mr. Abdulazeez returned from Jordan, changes were apparent to people around here, like the vendor who recognized him last month at a flea market in the nearby town of East Ridge. The vendor remembered him as a wrestling teammate of her grandson, and Mr. Abdulazeez\u2019s father had sold colognes at the flea market for years. But when she tried to strike up a conversation, the young man said nothing. The vendor told him he looked different and asked if he had grown a beard, and again he said nothing. She asked his name, and he remained silent. \u201cHe never said a word, and he didn\u2019t even look up at me or anything until I asked him his name, and then he walked away,\u201d said the woman, who did not want her name used. \u201cI guess he just didn\u2019t feel like dealing with me.\u201d Mr. Abdulazeez was short of money, and had looked into bankruptcy, but several months ago, he landed a job at Superior Essex, a wire and cable manufacturer in Franklin, near Nashville. His family hoped it was a turning point. He rented a room in Franklin and stayed there during the week, often making the two-hour drive back to Chattanooga to spend weekends with his family. But then, on April 20, he was arrested for driving under the influence, threatening the gains he had made. He was scheduled to appear in court on July 30. \u201cThere were times when he was just fine, and when he got the new job, they all felt like he was in a good place,\u201d until the drunken-driving charge, the family representative said. \u201cHe was in a good place, and then that happened.\u201d Manny Fernandez reported from Chattanooga, Alan Blinder from Atlanta, Eric Schmitt from Colorado Springs, and Richard P\u00e9rez-Pe\u00f1a from New York.

Both men were immigrants - Zorach from Lithuania and Trajan from Hungary - and both were sculptors who also painted. But while the one achieved considerable success in his lifetime, the other died in poverty, having failed to sell one work. Zorach's fame as a sculptor was closely connected with the ''truth to materials'' movement, which started in France as a reaction to Rodin and the studio system in general. Regarded at first as the ''esthetic left wing'' of sculpture and later as modern academism, the style derived its inspiration variously from folk, tribal and pre-Columbian art, as well as from Cubism, and yielded imagery subordinate to the shape and character of the materials from which it was made. Though this show includes five bronzes, some of which look to be translations of wood carvings, it focuses on Zorach's early years (1912-22), when he was working as a painter. Cezanne, Matisse and Cubism all influenced him, but evidently to little avail. There are several quite attractive watercolor landscapes - ''A Tree in Spring'' (1915), for example, where distant mountains rimmed in purple preside over green fields similarly treated, and a 1916 study of a schooner that evokes Van Gogh's fishing boats. But overall, the impression is of lostness. Zorach was prone to ''abstracting'' figures and landscape with Cubist facets, and he also tried to combine Cubism with Fauve color, as in the oil of a stylized woman and child in bright red, silhouetted against a yellow sunset. However, the forms of Yosemite, executed in both oils and watercolors, seem to have released an Expressionistic energy in him. Perhaps it was this that led him ultimately to sculpture. With the modernist revolution now processed by hindsight and by historians into inevitability, it is sometimes difficult to appreciate the gropings of its lesser adherents. Yet Cubism must have seemed, to all but the most brilliant and intuitive aspirants, as obscure as the Theory of Relativity, and it's no wonder that Zorach, like many others, never really got below its surface. The show indicates that the artist was both an emotional and a pragmatic personality for whom painting alone was too cerebral an activity. Though he continued to make watercolors - note the conventional 1926 view of Grenada - it is apparent that he needed the solidity of sculpture and the ritual of its craftsmanship to anchor him. Had Trajan been born a little earlier and remained in Europe, he might have helped revive the heroic aspects of sculpture, in the manner of Bourdelle. If he had lived much later, he would probably have benefited from the permissiveness of late modernism. As it was, he belonged nowhere and was unable either to impose his own vision or to submit to anyone else's. Though his tragedy, which included the humiliation (for a professional) of showing once in the Washington Square Outdoor Art Exhibition, is familiar, the man himself and the way in which he survived remains a mystery. Still he is known to have been somewhat mystical, and if the head - squarish and with deepset eyes and a tight mouth -that recurs in his art can be seen as a kind of selfportrait, he may well have been obstinate to the point of willfulness. As a painter of still lifes on paper, in a mixture of gouache, pastel and possibly oil, Trajan worked impressionistically in slashing strokes of rather pasty colors and left parts of the ground exposed. As a sculptor, he alternately modeled, using a kind of cement, and painted his forms. One of the two heads here is dabbed arbitrarily with many colors, the other has a yellow face, rusty red hair and is varnished overall. Two obviously imaginary works, ''Pagliacci'' and ''Helen of Troy,'' are touched only here and there with color. They are the most interesting pieces in the show, the first being a kneeling figure in doublet and ruff with winglike forms framing a face that resembles a gargoyle. Technically a high relief, the second figure stands wearing a long dress and a cloak and leans at an angle as if resting on a cane. The face -again with deep-set eyes and a determined mouth - is most haunting. There is neither a sense of time nor of place in the work (nothing is dated), nor is it clear whether or not the artist received formal training. Not to minimize its cruelty, the neglect that Trajan experienced seems not to have been gratuitous. He obviously could not and would not participate in his time. But he was no primitive either, and so his art lacked the childlike charm and eccentricity of, say, an Eilshemius, which, with luck and a nod from Marcel Duchamp, might have got him into art society through the back door. (Through July 10.) Other shows this week include: Kay Rosen/Kay Walkingstick (Urdang, 29 West 57th Street): Kay Rosen shows two large diagrams ruled in black and red ink on paper and a ''Notation'' in colored graphic tape on matte Mylar. In a complicated way, the drawings chart the progress of people walking up and down staircases in selected art institutions. Though the investigation is a perfect instance of scientific pointlessness, its results are not unpleasing - columns of short black lines, diagonal and horizontal, that are punctuated by red bars. The drawings look like the kind of herringbone tweed a computer might weave. Kay Walkingstick's canvases seem less sexual in connotation than they were, perhaps because the reviewer was seeing them for the first time out of a feminist group context. Until recently, Miss Walkingstick - the name is Cherokee - has worked on two layers of canvas, applying a thick mixture of encaustic and acrylic with her fingers. As the earlier works here show, the effect is of coarse, dark animal hide incised with one or two slits and scored with lines. Now that the artist is working on paper glued to board and is laying on thinner pigment with a knife, the paintings have acquired a greater, more mysterious power. Though smaller than before, they seem to have maintained - even gained - scale. Their leaden complexions, tinged with green, red, brown and blue, are of a rich, enameled quality, and the lozenge-shaped openings, treated in subtly contrasting hues, now look more like objects floating in space than lesions. This is intense and very promising work.

They estimated it stored the equivalent of three years of global fossil fuel emissions, making it one of the greatest carbon sinks on the planet, according to a paper published in the journal Nature.\nBut in August 2019, a Congolese company called Petroleum Exploration and Production Africa (Pepa) announced there were hundreds of millions of barrels of oil under the Cuvette Centrale. Exploiting this resource would quadruple the country\u2019s oil production and sort out its debt-ridden finances, the company claimed.\nIn a televised speech a few days later, Congo-Brazzaville\u2019s president, Denis Sassou-Nguesso, said the oil fields would not destroy the peatlands because they were on the periphery of drilling sites and added that he had \u201cno intention\u201d of ducking the obligation to protect the habitat. Environment minister Arlette Soudan-Nonault reinforced the message, telling Le Monde that drilling was \u201cnot in the peat bogs\u201d.\nHowever, according to the investigation, the environmental assessment that looked at the impact of the drilling in 2013 was written a year before the discovery of the peatlands in 2014. The head of Pepa told the Guardian an environmental impact study that was validated by the ministry of the environment was carried out before recent exploration work.\nTwo of the four potential underground reservoirs are directly under carbon-rich peatlands, according to analysis of publicly available data from researchers at the University of Leeds.\nGlobal Witness says it believes the proposed Ngoki oil block contains 6,000 sq km of peatland. Using data from the University of Leeds\u2019 online resource CongoPeat, the organisation estimates that draining this section of peatland alone could release 1.34 gigatonnes of carbon \u2013 the same as the total annual emissions of Japan.\nProf Simon Lewis, who led the UK-Congolese research team that found the peatlands, says preserving them is \u201cabsolutely essential in terms of meeting Paris agreement commitments\u201d. An influx of people to the region would also increase hunting, road building and further exploitation, he said. \u201cThere are huge amounts of carbon and biodiversity, and this should be one of the regions where we have different development pathways that don\u2019t lead to the destruction of the natural world. If it\u2019s not here in Congo, where is it possible? There\u2019s a real opportunity here to do something different and much better.\u201d\nThe Ngoki oil project is being spearheaded by Congolese oil baron Claude Wilfrid \u201cWilly\u201d Etoka, who is the 10th richest man in francophone Africa, believed to be worth more than $500m (\u00a3388m). He is chairman of Pepa as well as the company\u2019s major shareholder. Etoka claims the scheme will not damage the environment and told the Guardian the Ngoki project is \u201cfar from the peatlands\u201d.\n\u201cCompared to coastal oil operations, which can produce traces of marine pollution, oil exploration in the Cuvette presents no risk of environmental disturbance \u2026 The president of the Republic of the Congo, who is in charge of protecting the Congo basin, would not have authorised us to explore for oil there if there was any evidence of such risks,\u201d he said.\nSoudan-Nonault also told the Guardian the Ngoki permit was located \u201con the edge and outside\u201d of the peatland area.\nOil industry experts say proclamations of vast oil reserves have been exaggerated and, after looking at seismic surveys, Total and Shell rejected offers to invest in Ngoki in 2015. A senior source at Shell said seismic surveys showed the oil deposits were probably \u201cmodest\u201d and \u201cgiven the surface risk and operational challenges in this area, the \u2018size of the prize\u2019 would have to be very substantial\u201d.\nCritics say the exploration done so far \u2013 a 2D seismic survey and one exploratory well in 2019 \u2013 are not sufficient to work out the size of the oil reservoir. A geologist chartered with the Geological Society of London who looked at the seismic survey described it as \u201cvery basic\u201d and said \u201cthere could be nothing of significance\u201d. Pepa claims that a large well was discovered during drilling.\nFrancis Perrin, a senior research fellow with an expertise in oil and gas at the Institut de Relations Internationales et Strat\u00e9giques says Pepa\u2019s claims that the Ngoki oil project could produce 900,000 barrels a day are \u201cridiculous\u201d. \n\u201cSerious international companies will not invest in this project until Pepa can put their findings on the table,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not enough to have one survey \u2013 you have to do multiple surveys and that can take months or years, depending on the size of the discovery.\u201d\nEtoka told the Guardian the size of the oil discovery was based on \u201cobjectively verifiable data\u201d. He added: \u201cProduction tests will tell us a little more in days to come. We are continuing to keep a low profile while awaiting confirmation.\u201d President Sassou-Nguesso declined to comment.\nColin Robertson, a campaigner from Global Witness who worked on the investigation, said: \u201cThe vast amounts of carbon stored in Congo basin\u2019s peatland forests means they are of global importance in the fight against climate change. These are the one of the last places on Earth that extracting more fossil fuels should be considered. Any responsible investor should rule this out.\u201d", "label": 0}, "dev-53": {"text": "Blaze destroys 2 Fire Island resorts and 2 nearby homes\nFriday, March 27, 2015, 1:21 PM A pair of iconic gay resorts were destroyed early Friday in a fast-moving Fire Island blaze that raged for hours and gutted two nearby private homes. More than 100 firefighters, including some brought from the mainland by ferry, battled the massive fire that began around 1:30 a.m. inside the Holly House, said Cherry Grove Assistant Fire Chief Craig Williams. The flames soon spread from the three-story, seasonal apartment complex to the Grove Hotel, the largest hotel on the island and home to the annual end-of-the-season Miss Fire Island drag contest. Two private homes in the Cherry Grove section were destroyed and three others damaged before the blaze was declared under control at 11:20 a.m., said Williams. All of the buildings involved were unoccupied. The cause of the blaze was under investigation by Suffolk County police and Town of Brookhaven fire marshals, the assistant chief said. The wind whipping across the island, coupled with the low off-season manpower at local firehouses, created problems in battling the blaze, said Williams. Twenty-two departments and six EMS crews eventually responded to the fire, with three firefighters suffering minor injuries.

But historically, the US has contributed more carbon dioxide to the atmosphere than any other nation. The US also has high emissions per capita, compared to other developed countries. And Americans buy products made in China, therefore supporting China's carbon footprint.\u00a0\nSources told the news agency that the statement of priorities included the importance of examining the implications of global heating for financial stability, as part of the work of the G20\u2019s Financial Stability Board, the steering group for international banking industry rules.\nThe language represented a compromise to overcome opposition from US officials at the first major meeting of Saudi Arabia\u2019s year-long presidency of the G20, according to the sources. An attempt to include references to the downside risks for global growth posed by the climate crisis was dropped.\nConcerns about the economic damage from rising global temperatures and extreme weather events have risen up the agenda among world leaders, central bankers and financiers in recent years. The financial system continues to fund activities that are inconsistent with meeting climate targets, paving the way for trillions of pounds of financial losses in the future and catastrophic environmental consequences should the world economy fail to adapt.\nThe meetings in Riyadh were attended by Mark Carney, who has driven the climate emergency up the agenda among world leaders and financial regulators to stake a legacy at the Bank of England before he stands down as governor next month. The new chancellor, Rishi Sunak, stayed in London to continue preparing for next month\u2019s budget, instead sending a senior civil servant from the Treasury.\nReuters reported that the communique issued at the end of the meetings in the oil-rich Gulf state would be the first to include references to climate change since Trump became president in 2017.\nThe International Monetary Fund included climate-related disasters in a list of the risks facing a highly fragile recovery in the global economy this year. However, the increasing focus comes as US officials resist naming global heating as an economic risk, following Trump\u2019s move at the outset of his presidency to withdraw the world\u2019s largest economy from the Paris climate accords.\n\u2022 This article was amended on 26 February 2020.

From the impromptu games of \"town ball\" in the 1800s, through Jackie Robinson's Montreal Royals to the Expos and Blue Jays, Canadians have always been infatuated with baseball. But getting big league teams to come to Canada proved harder than hitting a grand slam. It took decades of persuading, promoting, wheeling and dealing, but eventually America's favourite pastime found a home in the great white north. At last! This week it is announced that Toronto will become the 14th American League franchise. As yet, the team has no name, no logo and no players. But it does have a stadium, refurbished at great expense long before the awarding of a franchise. As we hear in this clip, the announcement is a huge relief for Metro Toronto chairman Paul Godfrey, Canadian National Exhibition stadium manager Gordon Walker and Labatt sales manager Dave Kashin. . Two Toronto groups lobbied for ownership of the new American League franchise. One group was headed by Labatt Breweries with partners Imperial Trust Ltd. and the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce. Another bid was entered by Atlantic Packaging Ltd. The Labatt group won. . In 2003 the controlling interest in the Blue Jays was owned by media mogul Ted Rogers. . The name \"Toronto Blue Jays\" was selected in a \"Name the Team\" contest. Over 30,000 entries were received; 154 suggested the name Blue Jays. Their blue uniforms maintained the tradition of blue attire for Toronto teams, including the Toronto Maple Leafs hockey team and the Toronto Argonauts football team. It didn't hurt that the team was owned by Labatt, brewers of Labatt Blue (a beer that was named after the Winnipeg Blue Bombers football team.) . Baseball has a tradition of naming teams after birds. Other current bird-themed squads include the Baltimore Orioles and the St. Louis Cardinals. . In 1944-45, the Philadelphia Phillies were renamed the Blue Jays after a similar \"name the team\" contest, but the name didn't stick. . A blue jay is a medium-sized, colourful bird found across eastern North America. Like some baseball fans, they are known for their loud voices and aggressive manner. . Before the Blue Jays, Toronto had another professional baseball team, the Maple Leafs baseball club. The Maple Leafs joined the International League in 1886 under the name Canucks. They won the championship the following year and in their heyday the team attracted 25,000 fans. But interest in the team declined as Toronto's prospects for acquiring a Major League Baseball franchise grew. By 1967 they drew less than 1,000 fans a game and left the league.

One win on one night can rarely accomplish as much as this ACC Championship triumph did for Florida State University. Texas scores decisive win, heads to Rose BowlTexas 70, Colorado 3 Lost amidst the hoopla of clinching a spot in college football's national title game, a less dramatic reality emerged for the Texas Longhorns on a sweet, sunny Saturday in Houston.Yes, the focus in Austin will now shift to Pasadena for the next month, but for this one day, the talk of Texas should be the fact that Mack Brown attained the previously unattainable: a Big XII championship. Texas 70, Colorado 3 Lost amidst the hoopla of clinching a spot in college football's national title game, a less dramatic reality emerged for the Texas Longhorns on a sweet, sunny Saturday in Houston. Yes, the focus in Austin will now shift to Pasadena for the next month, but for this one day, the talk of Texas should be the fact that Mack Brown attained the previously unattainable: a Big XII championship. This was a not-too-dramatic matchup on paper, and it was equally devoid of intrigue on the field. After a first-drive Buffalo fumble ... and a second-drive case of the dropsies ... and a third-drive blocked field goal ... and a fourth-drive red zone nightmare for CU, the game was already getting out of hand. Then, when Vince Young decided to put his foot down and shake off the memory of a poor performance the week before, the game was over. With one impressive red zone run and one flick of the wrist on a perfect pass to Limas Sweed (think Steve Young to Terrell Owens in the 1999 NFC wild card game; those two passes were extraordinarily similar, from \"Young\" arms), the Longhorns had a 28-3 bulge early in the second quarter, and the issue was decided. Precisely because this game was ridiculously, almost pathetically, easy for Texas \u0097 and because conventional pregame wisdom suggested it would be \u0097 some Longhorn fans understandably found it hard to treat this game as anything other than a steppingstone to Pasadena, as an obstacle to be \"gotten over with.\" Because the Big XII title game opponent was not a Frank Solich Nebraska team, or an Ell Roberson-led Kansas State team, or the Bobby Pesavento-Bobby Purify-Chris Brown Colorado team that shattered Texas' 2001 title hopes, this contest lacked juice. It didn't feel like a true championship game, given the extraordinary disparity in talent and focus between the two teams. But a championship game it was, and before dreaming of the Tournament of Roses and a second straight trip to the Granddaddy, Longhorns of all ages can contemplate the fact that nine years after John Mackovic, James Brown, Priest Holmes, and Derek Lewis engineered a titanic upset of Nebraska to win the school's first Big XII crown, Mack Brown and Vince Young finally brought the Burnt Orange Bevo Boys another league title. Moreover, they did so in Houston's Reliant Stadium by avoiding the very trap that the 1996 'Horns laid for Nebraska in St. Louis. After all the years of playing second-fiddle to Oklahoma, all the off-seasons without a league title, the Longhorns didn't just have to crush the Sooners this season; they needed to be victorious on this day in this setting. The fact that an error-prone opponent from Boulder put up no resistance should not take away from the magnitude of this moment for a redeemed coach, his Heisman Trophy candidate \u0097 who played a strong game to put pressure on Reggie Bush \u0097 and a program that basks in the glow of a prodigious accomplishment: winning the Big XII. Yeah, going to the shadows of the San Gabriel Mountains is bigger in the big picture, but first things first: Texas won a championship game today for the first time since 1996. Before the Mack Brown redemption tour claims an even bigger prize, the Texas coach had to bag the league title that eluded him for so long. So while the Horns wait to see if USC does indeed join them in a football version of the Run for the Roses, they can and should appreciate the fact that they finally knocked down the Big XII door that resisted their advances over the past nine years. Texas football witnessed a not-very-dramatic game on Saturday, but that shouldn't take away from the fact that, while the eyes of Texas switch to the West Coast, the Horns have finally hooked a very important conference title to validate their season of dominance.

USC 66, UCLA 13 Amidst the sexiness of the Song Girls and the flash-and-dash of L.A., the two-time defending national champions reminded UCLA and the rest of the college football world of one very simple reality on a sun-splashed Saturday afternoon: they can and will punch you in the mouth.

If you want to look to the soul of this USC team, go in the trenches where the big uglies reside. Matua. Lutui. Kalil. Baker. Justice. These five men didn't need a passing game; didn't need an effective Matt Leinart; didn't need creative play-calling; and didn't need any outside luck to bash UCLA's defense into submission, play after punishing play. It was a bloodbath in the old Coliseum, as the nation of Troy recalled the days when the Roman Empire devoured physically inferior opposition with legendary ruthlessness and power. And the principal agents of this Trojan conquest were those five gladiators up front, who came, saw and conquered in a game so markedly different from USC's narrow houdini in Pasadena last December. Matt Leinart played poorly in the first half, a result of a huge Senior Day adrenaline rush the college football legend wasn't able to contain. USC's receivers \u0097 who will be the biggest key for the Trojans when they play Texas on January 4 \u0097 still couldn't impose their will on the Bruins' corners. Lane Kiffin and Steve Sarkisian were insistent on using the ground game... even in long-yardage situations, and even with a nonexistent passing attack. And it didn't matter. Not one bit. Regardless of the down and distance, and removed from the struggles of USC's passing game, one thing about this lopsided game remained constant from its first moment to the bitter end: when USC decided to run, UCLA couldn't do thing one to stop a dominant offensive line from bludgeoning a soft and rusty defense to death. Bush amazed with his leaps and juke moves, but the stud running back \u0097 one of the most electrifying in the long and storied history of college football \u0097 wouldn't have been able to initially get into the clear (as has been the case all season long) if his horses up front hadn't been able to obliterate their opposite numbers. Aside of the overwhelming display from USC's offensive front, the Trojans showed something else in this game that impressed a lot of observers: their defense punched UCLA in the mouth as well. Pete Carroll was disappointed in his own defensive coaching and play calling after the Fresno State game, and in the subsequent two weeks, he obviously fixed a lot of problems. The Trojans' defense flew to the ball in a smothering, suffocating performance. Maurice Jones-Drew, who had a seemingly free run through other Pac-10 defenses this year, met a stiff wall of resistance on Saturday. Vaunted UCLA tight end Mercedes Lewis got summarily shut down. Drew Olson got pounded while failing to make big plays with his vertical passing game. USC was able to physically dominate UCLA without giving up home-run plays on any occasion. The dominance in the trenches in this game didn't just belong to USC's offense; Pete Carroll's defense was just as authoritative. While the Bruins wouldn't have been able to beat Troy with the way USC blocked for Reggie Bush, the boys from Westwood still figured to remain competitive based on the strength of their offense. But with USC dominating up front on defense, this game ceased being interesting well before halftime. In the last home game for Matt Leinart and, in all probability, Reggie Bush, USC's full collection of seniors and last-year players couldn't have written a better Hollywood script. A team that wanted to finish off a second straight unbeaten regular season and advance to the Rose Bowl also wanted to do something else: to make the Bruins look bad. A year after overlooking the Bruins in a shaky five-point win, Troy wanted to make a statement against its in-city rival across the freeway. USC fullback Brandon Hancock called the Bruins \"pansies\" in the week before kickoff, an indication that the Trojans view UCLA in much lower esteem than Notre Dame, the team that nearly ruined this dream season for college football's preeminent program. After making UCLA's exceptional 9-2 season seem as hollow as a 9-2 season can be, the Trojans \u0097 before they play in UCLA's home stadium in a month \u0097 will savor the personally satisfying nature of this particular triumph. Texas can wait a little while. For this afternoon, USC settled some old scores, won another on-campus home game, dusted off the powder-blue enemy, won an outright Pac-10 title, sustained all its streaks, and sent Matt Leinart out a winner. Not bad for a day's work in the life of college football's Roman Empire. This latest conquest of UCLA was a ruthless display Julius Caesar would surely have approved of. Georgia, Shockley bully LSUGeorgia 34, LSU 14 His defense came up with huge turnovers and his special teams unit made game-changing plays, but this night belonged to D.J. Shockley. For three years, he waited behind David Greene, getting occasional opportunities under center but never managing to wrest the starting job away from the signal caller who wound up winning more games than any other quarterback in Division I-A college football history. For three seasons, Shockley was more of a bystander than a participant in America's most cutthroat conference. For three Autumns, Shockley wasn't in the center of the action, even while his program remained a fixture on the SEC landscape.

For three years, he waited behind David Greene, getting occasional opportunities under center but never managing to wrest the starting job away from the signal caller who wound up winning more games than any other quarterback in Division I-A college football history. For three seasons, Shockley was more of a bystander than a participant in America's most cutthroat conference. For three Autumns, Shockley wasn't in the center of the action, even while his program remained a fixture on the SEC landscape. Those three years in the wildnerness were worth it, though, for they fashioned and molded the Georgia senior into a battle-tested leader who was able to make the most of his first and last SEC Championship Game as a starting quarterback. When given a chance to inscribe his name in the history books, Shockley \u0097 realizing how precious and special this occasion was \u0097 wasted no time making his mark on this contest, in which the Dawgs gained sweet revenge for a beating they received from the Tigers two years ago on the very same Georgia Dome field. Shockley has always had the tools of a great quarterback, but on Saturday night against LSU, he blended athleticism with precision in a command performance that prevented Les Miles' team from getting the upper hand early on. With two incredibly impressive long balls to Sean Bailey, Shockley gave UGA a 14-0 bulge that gave the mistake-prone Tigers little margin for error. And when a blocked punt exceeded that margin of error, Shockley made the SEC West champions pay for their sloppiness by running in a touchdown to restore order and give the Dawgs a 21-7 lead. When JaMarcus Russell got injured in the third quarter, LSU \u0097 who lost its starting quarterback for the second time in three SEC title games (Matt Mauck relieved Rohan Davey in 2001 against Tennessee, albeit with much more success) \u0097 saw any realistic comeback hopes evaporate. Shockley \u0097 with a strong start and a steady hand \u0097 set the tone for a Georgia win that was helped by the game-turning block of a Chris Jackson punt, and finished off with a Tim Jennings pick-six on a telegraphed Matt Flynn pass. Within a complete team victory for Mark Richt's program \u0097 which now stands alongside LSU with two SEC titles in this decade \u0097 it was the quarterback who emerged from the shadows who wrote this night's most poignant chapter. D.J. Shockley is the man whose leadership formed the emotional centerpiece of a redemptive moment in the life of Georgia football. Les Miles' team overcame a great deal in merely getting to this point; the absence of an SEC title should not diminish what LSU accomplished in fighting through storms, postponements and close-shave white-knucklers during an unforgettable 2005 season. But for all LSU did to win the West, the SEC's much tougher division, it is Georgia who becomes the SEC's biggest winner in 2005. With Richt, the coach who overcame an enormous amount of attrition to fashion one of the best coaching jobs America never heard about this year, and Mr. Shockley, the quarterback who made his one big season count Between the Hedges, the Dawgs won their second league title in four years while getting some revenge against the Bayou Bengals as well. Both teams will play again in the Georgia Dome over the following month; the only difference is that LSU will play in 2005 against Boston College or Clemson, while Georgia will play in 2006 against West Virginia. For the real difference between these two teams, you have to look to two places: the rings that Georgia's players will eventually wear, and the smile that won't ever be removed from D.J. Shockley's face. Tonight, a senior quarterback won a championship his way and on his terms, proving to the SEC and America that, in the end, it's easy not being Greene.

The proposal, which would have brought 260,000 new flights a year to the airport, was dead and campaigners celebrated because similar schemes were now doomed.\nBut are they? It\u2019s tempting to forecast the future using simple cause and effect, assuming that the court of appeal ruling must now cause Heathrow and similar climate-busting projects to stop, thus accelerating Britain\u2019s transition to a carbon-free economy. But sadly, that\u2019s just one possible scenario. The effect of the ruling could be to expand smaller, regional airports. Most Heathrow flights are for pleasure; determined travellers could pile into Luton, Stansted, Birmingham. More might decide to drive. Even though the government says it won\u2019t appeal, the transport minister, Grant Shapps, has also said, in principle, it does \u201cwant to see airport expansion\u201d. Heathrow will appeal against the decision. It could win. Nature could still lose.\nThe future is uncertain because cause and effect are rarely simple. A single cause can have any number of effects, some predictable but many unforeseen. Something can be generally certain \u2013 such as the law courts having to take the government\u2019s commitment to the Paris accord seriously \u2013 but specifically ambiguous: because no two projects are identical, all future judgments may not favour the environment.\nMinor differences in projects may result in widely varying outcomes. You can see the same difficulty with epidemics. That they will keep happening is generally certain, but it is risky to extrapolate from one to the other because there is no profile of an epidemic. We don\u2019t know where or when the next epidemics will break out, or what diseases might cause them. They don\u2019t repeat themselves. Expecting to see the future through a simple unfolding of cause and effect is easy but risky.\nBut simple cause-and-effect thinking has plagued forecasting since telling the future became big business at the end of the 19th century. One of the founding fathers of economic forecasting, Roger Babson, was adamant in his Newtonian view of the world. For him, every action had to be associated with an equal and opposite reaction. He not only assembled the largest collection of Newtoniana in North America, but based his entire economic theory on this premise, one of the first (but not the last) to believe he could develop laws of economics that had the same absolute certainty as the laws of physics.\nHis view of cause and effect had a boost in 1929 when, as he had predicted, Wall Street crashed. This, Babson argued, was because periods of wasteful exuberance always produce the need for sensible self-discipline. But he had been forecasting a correction for the previous three years. And when, in May 1931, he announced the market had bottomed out and it was time to get back in, he was wrong: the US economy didn\u2019t recover for a decade.\nSimple causes make memorable stories, but the sheer complexity of life militates against straightforward narratives\nLike most pundits, Babson was poor at reviewing his own forecasts; he continued to believe everything in life could be reduced to simple laws. As a young man, he was told he had contracted TB \u2013 at the time, the single greatest cause of death in the western world. However shattering, the diagnosis was nonetheless ambiguous: it could mean a quick death or that the disease would lie latent for decades. Not a man to stand by and wait, Babson devised a health regimen that he was convinced would keep catastrophe at bay.\nHe chose an office surrounded by windows, all of which he kept wide open, even throughout the brutal Massachusetts winters. He and his secretary wore mittens and hooded, floor-length wool cloaks as they worked, the secretary typing with wooden mallets and Babson wearing an electrically heated pad in his back. Was it these eccentricities that allowed Babson to live to 91? It\u2019s impossible to know. He might not even have had TB, since no accurate test was devised until years later.\nThe same problem bedevils studies of leadership. It is fashionable to follow high-profile business leaders and draw from them lessons of success. Steve Jobs and Bill Gates created huge, valuable companies \u2013 but how far was their success attributable to them as individuals, and how far the result of other factors: the thousands of people who worked for them, the short-sightedness of their competitors, the wealthy ecosystem they inherited, and a growing educated populace? It\u2019s impossible to do the experiment, Apple without Jobs, or Microsoft without Gates.\nSeeing individuals as single causes of complex success is an attribution error routinely made when analysing politicians too: did Churchill really win the Second World War, or were Hitler\u2019s unforced errors and the brute force of the Soviet Union more important?\nSimple causes make memorable stories, but that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re true. The sheer complexity of life militates against straightforward narratives and it can feel as though the sides have come off the billiard table, balls dropping off or arriving from anywhere. You don\u2019t know how many variables there are, where they may come from or which, if any, will matter. That\u2019s why, increasingly, efficiency gives way to robustness.\nWhen the stakes are high (as in epidemics) a bold response is safer than complacency. Which is why the campaigners celebrating last week\u2019s appeal court judgment will have to return to their fight if they want to increase their chances of environmental success.\n\u2022 Margaret Heffernan is the author of Uncharted: How To Map the Future Together", "label": 0}, "dev-58": {"text": "Real Estate - Homes for Sale\n123 real estate listings in California Zip Code 94027 Showing 10 of 10 out of 123 on the map Showing 1 - 10 of 123 Sort by: New ListingsPrice High-LowPrice Low-HighBedroomsBathroomsSqFt ARCHITECTURALLY DESIGNED BY WILLIAM ARTHUR PATRICK IN THE TRADITION OF FRANK LLOYD WRIGHT...

The prime minister, Scott Morrison, has suggested he may introduce national standards that would report on how much hazard reduction the states carried out each year.\nSpeaking in parliament on Wednesday, Morrison said hazard reduction was at least as important as reducing greenhouse gas emissions to protect people as fire seasons worsened.\nThe University of Melbourne desktop analysis used Rural Fire Service data to compare the size and severity of this season\u2019s bushfires area with hazard reduction burns over the past five years. The majority of the area in which there had been prescribed burning had been razed again by bushfire in the past three months.\nPatrick Baker, a professor of silviculture and forest ecology, said the prescribed burning did not \u201cseem to have done much at all\u201d in areas that faced a crowning bushfire that burned the canopy.\nHe said the fire that devastated the NSW south coast between Batemans Bay and Jervis Bay over the new year scored 3.95 out of 4 on a severity scale despite recent hazard reduction burns in the area, some of which scored up to 3.8. \u201cPretty much the whole area was torched,\u201d Baker said.\nThe analysis found prescribed burning was likely to have helped save property in areas on the fringe of major fire complexes where the flames were less severe, such as Katoomba in the Blue Mountains.\nBaker said it suggested prescribed burning was most effective when used as part of a risk-based system designed to help protect chosen assets \u2013 human life, biodiversity, property and water catchments \u2013 rather than based on an arbitrary numeric target. He said a 5% annual target risked leading to swathes of remote landscape being burned without significantly reducing the risk to assets.\nIn Victoria, for example, burning the sandy soiled landscape in the Mallee, which makes up nearly a fifth of the state, would do little to protect assets but could have a catastrophic impact on native animals and plants, he said.\n\u201cWe need to be smart about where we burn,\u201d Baker said. \u201cThe other issue is we don\u2019t have endless resources to do this. It\u2019s extraordinarily expensive, so if people want to double or triple or quadruple prescribed burning, the question is what else are we not going to get done?\u201d\nMorrison announced on Tuesday that former a defence chief, Mark Binskin, would lead a royal commission into the bushfire crisis, which has claimed 33 lives, destroyed thousands of homes and is estimated to have killed more than 1bn animals.\nScientists and former emergency service chiefs say the climate crisis has exacerbated fire risk and reduced the window each year in which hazard reduction burning can be safely carried out. They say the increased threat demands both greater resources to fight fires and urgent action to cut emissions.\nA group of 31 ex-fire and emergency bosses will write to Morrison on Thursday saying the royal commission will be a waste of time and money if it does not examine the role of climate change.\nIn a statement released on Wednesday night, Greg Mullins, the former NSW fire and rescue commissioner, said: \u201cClimate change has increased fire danger so much that fires now burn freely through areas that have undergone hazard reduction burning recently. I saw fires a metre high burning across mown lawns while fighting fires at Batemans Bay on New Year\u2019s Eve.\u201d\nThe current Rural Fire Service commissioner, Shane Fitzsimmons, told the ABC on Wednesday that, while some objected to the description, the ongoing fire crisis was clearly unprecedented. He said no fire season had taken as many lives, destroyed as many homes and burned through a quarter of the state\u2019s forested country across the Great Dividing Range. \u201cThe reality is it has been an extraordinary, difficult, damaging, destructive, fatal and tragic fire season, and it is without precedent,\u201d he said.\nThe 5% annual hazard reduction target was recommended by the royal commission into the 2009 Black Saturday bushfires in Victoria, which killed 173 people. Neil Comrie, a former Victoria police chief commissioner who was appointed to oversee implementation of the royal commission\u2019s recommendations, later found the target was likely to not be achievable, affordable or sustainable, and the primary focus should be protection of lives and communities.\nThe Victorian Andrews government dropped the 5% goal and adopted a risk-based approach in 2016, pledging to focus on reducing fuel loads close to communities and in remote back-country areas where fires can start, grow and build in intensity.\nJohn Thwaites, a former Victorian deputy premier and environment minister and now the chairman of Monash Sustainable Development Institute, said despite claims the states were not doing enough, fuel reduction had risen 61% in Victoria in the decade following the Black Saturday fires compared with the previous 10 years.\nEven with that increase, the state met its increased hazard reduction targets only twice before moving to the risk-based system three years ago. It planned to burn 246,000 hectares in 2019, but managed little more than half that because it was not safe to burn, officials said.\nIn NSW, both the National Parks and Wildlife Service and Rural Fire Service met hectare-based targets for fuel reduction last year, but the rural service fell short of a goal of limiting fire hazards around 113,130 properties.\nThwaites said higher temperatures, drier fuel and stronger winds were increasingly making it unsafe to burn in autumn and spring, but a risk-based approach using sophisticated modelling such as that being adopted in Victoria would reduce the likelihood that homes were lost.", "label": 0}, "dev-60": {"text": "Hypocrites, Damned Hypocrites, & Climate Troughers\nLeonardo Di Caprio and his superyachts.

And to hear a lot of pundits tell it, humans are to blame and the Trump administration is doing nothing about it.\n\nThey have attributed this storm and the frequency of similar natural disasters to climate change and, by extension, the Trump administration\u2019s climate policies.\n\nBecause of the president\u2019s withdrawal from the Paris climate accords, which hasn\u2019t officially even happened yet, and his proposed rollback of Obama-era fuel economy mandates, President Donald Trump is complicit in the ensuing devastation to the Carolinian coasts. The \u201cnever let a crisis go to waste\u201d crowd is questioning whether this is our new \u201cclimate-change-fueled reality.\u201d\nWhat\u2019s the real story? As climatologist Ryan Maue says, \u201cAnyone trying to score political points after a natural disaster should take a deep breath and review the science first.\u201d In fact, evidence from leading climatologists and the federal government\u2019s National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration demonstrates how climate change has little effect on the frequency of these disasters.\n\nA study by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration of the historical records of hurricane counts and sea surface temperatures since the late 1880s concluded that: While global mean temperature and tropical Atlantic [sea and surface temperatures] show pronounced and statistically significant warming trends \u2026 the U.S. landfalling hurricane record \u2026 shows no significant increase or decrease \u2026 In short, the historical Atlantic hurricane record does not provide compelling evidence for a substantial greenhouse warming-induced long-term increase\nThe agency\u2019s Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory model also shows a\u201csubstantial decrease (~25 percent) in the overall number of Atlantic hurricanes and tropical storms with projected 21st century climate warming.\u201d\n\nMaue comes to a similar conclusion: \u201cMy own research, cited in a recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report, found that during the past half-century tropical storms and hurricanes have not shown an upward trend in frequency or accumulated energy. Instead they remain naturally variable from year-to-year.\u201d\n\nOver the last century, there have been no statistically significant trends in hurricane landfall. The frequency of these storms rose and fell at a natural rate disassociated with the rise in surface sea temperatures. Trump\u2019s policies are no more likely to have \u201ccaused\u201d Hurricane Florence or made it worse than President Barack Obama\u2019s.\n\nThe evidence not only refutes claims that climate change causes more frequent hurricanes, it is conflicted on how climate change affects the intensity of these storms.\n\nIn the same National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration report, scientists find that \u201cWhile one of our modeling studies projects a large (~100%) increase in Atlantic category 4-5 hurricanes over the 21st century, we estimate that such an increase would not be detectable until the latter half of the century, and we still have only low confidence that such an increase will occur in the Atlantic basin \u2026 \u201d\n\nClimatologist Cliff Mass, who studied the effects of climate change on Hurricane Harvey, puts the actual impact of warmer sea surface temperatures on storm intensity into perspective.\n\n\u201cLet us assume that all of the .5 \u00b0C warming of the Gulf was due to human-caused global warming \u2026 that NONE of it was natural,\u201d he writes. \u201cAnd that the air was warmed by the same amount \u2026 [this] implies an increase of 3.5 percent in the extreme precipitation of this storm. So for places that received 30 inches, perhaps 1 inch resulted from global warming. Not much. Immaterial regarding impacts or anything else.\u201d\n\nUnsurprisingly, last year\u2019s string of hurricanes, and now Florence, have prompted aggressive policy action to combat climate change. Such proposed actions include the prohibition, restriction, and taxation of natural resources that emit carbon dioxide when burned.\n\nIn a recent interview, climate activist Bill McKibben said, \u201cWe know that we need to keep most of the coal and oil and gas that we know about underground if we have any hope of meeting the targets that everybody agreed to in Paris.\u201d\n\nCoal, oil, and natural gas are the abundant, affordable, and dependable energy sources that make the world go round. We light and heat our homes with them. We power our vehicles. They are critical to just about every component of life and have been instrumental in raising standards of living in the United States and around the world to the highest levels ever.\n\nIn fact, these natural resources have comprised at least 80 percent of the U.S. energy mix for more than a century. They\u2019ve powered 80 percent of the entire world\u2019s energy needs. Artificially restricting their use through taxes, regulations, and mandates are costly non-solutions that distract from more present-minded efforts to mitigate and adapt to the impacts of extreme weather.\n\nUsing the same climate sensitivity (the warming effect of a doubling of carbon dioxide emissions) as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change assumes in its modeling, the world would be only 0.137 degrees Celsius cooler by 2100. Even if the entire industrialized world cut its carbon dioxide emissions entirely, the averted warming would amount to only 0.278 degrees Celsius by the turn of the century.\n\nAs thousands of our fellow Americans experience this terrible tragedy, no one is in a position to place blame on any one official or administration, nor use this catastrophe as a justification for their costly and ineffective climate policies.\n\nRather than attack one another over who is responsible for the latest disaster, let us instead commit our energy to helping the victims of Hurricane Florence and implementing the right policies to better protect and respond to future disasters.", "label": 1}, "dev-62": {"text": "The Final Piece in the Climate Change Jigsaw Puzzle\nBy John Rofe\nIt is easy for someone with a balanced perspective to see why it is impossible for carbon dioxide (CO2) to have any measurable effect on climate. Further, from 100 years ago, starting with the superstars of science like Anders Angstrom and Niels Bohr onwards, the scientific community has understood why the Beer-Lambert law (note a \u2018law\u2019 of science, not just an unsubstantiated and already disproven theory), makes it impossible for any extra human CO2 emissions to materially change the climate. Only wads of money and a lust for power could and did change that.\nIt has long been known that with increased solar insolation comes extra heat and consequently extra evaporation. In this manner, water vapour picks up the role for the earth that sweat performs for the human body.\nWith its sheer volume and ability to phase-change between gas, liquid and solid, it is hugely superior to the three human-generated emissions of CO2, CH4 and N2O that we are taught to vilify. Water vapour, together with clouds govern almost the full extent of infra-red re-radiation from the earth\u2019s surface into outer space.\nMankind has no role in this. It is the solar cycles.\nThe time has come for reality to displace the elaborate fiction created under the auspices of the United Nations directed climate change fraud. It has long been known that CO2 is colourless, odourless, non-toxic at atmospheric concentrations and essential for the survival of all life on earth. Further, more atmospheric CO2 means more plant food to help the greening of the planet.\nLess atmospheric CO2 means all plant life suffers because it is so essential to support photosynthesis. The charade of any political party that refers to itself as \u201cgreen\u201d attempting to tax CO2 and thereby reduce its concentration is bizarre in the extreme. James Shaw should be ashamed of his role in this fraud.\nI will therefore not make a submission to the \u201czero carbon bill\u201d because although elaborate, it is just a fraud \u2013 and a heavily promoted mania for subversive political purposes.\nThe news media needs to take the time to talk to its NZCSC members to gain a more thorough understanding of these truths. NIWA and the current advisers to the government are not part of the solution, but their role must be investigated by the proper authorities because they are clearly an integral part of the fraud and surely must be well paid for that role.\nI suggest the time is now ripe for the leader of the opposition to change science advisers and demand the resignation of both the Prime Minister and the Minister of Climate Change. The summary details on the first link below should be enough to explain why.\nThere are a number of members of the New Zealand Climate Science Coalition who understand every one of the reasons why this government has become a fraudulent enterprise but those experts have been denied access to the news media.\nI am now prepared to release a copy of my complaint to the NZ Serious Fraud Office, which explains the drama, for anyone with a stomach to see the fraud in all its gory glory. The SFO assistance will likely no longer be required if politicians take the required action.\nSo what is new and so dramatic?\nBecause the peer-reviewed report by the team at the University of Northumbria was to be published this week on nature.com, the people at NASA last week cynically front-ran some similar if superficial findings based on the (now outdated) solar dynamo studies of one researcher.\nThis showed on the NASA web site that solar cycle 25, due to commence in several months, would introduce a cooling climate.\nThe report showed an equivalence in solar activity to the early stage of the Maunder Minimum (so cold then that the seas froze, in what became known as the \u201cLittle Ice Age\u201d which ran from 1280- 1850AD). NASA then \u201cdamned their contractor\u2019s report with faint praise\u201d.\nThis treatment is not unexpected. Many are now aware that the two huge US environmental agencies NASA and NOAA, have been corrupted by the UN politics of \u201cclimate change\u201d and have been guilty of data tampering with historical terrestrial temperature data since the year 2000.\nThe evidence of this malfeasance is known to the present US administration, and all lies in plain sight. NASA\u2019s actions are just a few of the dozens of decentralised supporting conspiracies to make \u201ca lion look like a pig\u201d (in the case of CO2) or make \u201ca sow\u2019s ear look like a silk purse\u201d (in terms of their carbon vilification fraud).\nThe report, the URL for which is shown below, by Professor Valentina Zharkova and her team, has not come out of the blue. Her team\u2019s dedicated work has been validated by similar projects at the major Russian scientific institutes. Her team was recently augmented by the addition of Dr Popova from Moscow to utilise all available international knowledge.\nThere are numerous books and peer-reviewed papers about the role of solar cycles in dominating the changes to the earth\u2019s climate. Readers of this article can get some of those from the public library if they want. These reports are deliberately suppressed in mainstream media as part of the UN\u2019s global \u201cclimate change\u201d conspiracy which has been run under protest from genuine sceptics within the OECD from 1988 to the present.\nA string of experiments and observations leading to earlier reports by her team over the last 4-5 years have already marked Professor Zharkova as the leader in this field \u2013 at least in the West. The Russians have always adopted solar cycles as the primary reason for climate change\u2026that is why they build so many nuclear-powered icebreakers in anticipation of what is to come. To the tightly controlled Western media, that penny has yet to drop!\nWhen the general public realises the true significance of this press release, Professor Zharkova and her team will become more famous than any other climate scientists, and likely on par with all-time greats in other fields from her own astrophysics specialisation.The learned paper is a work which can either be accepted as the pin to burst our Minister of Climate Change\u2019s bubble or denied for a few more months until the world awakens to the enormity of the fraud being perpetrated on the average citizen.\nComprehension of the paper as published suffers from the complexity of the issue for laypeople, and from shortcomings in Professor Zharkova\u2019s English language skills, so please view the video below which has a summary from the GSM channel which has been studying this avenue of science for some years.\nIt provides a comparison between the NASA and Zharkova papers. Please note that the GSM channel has scheduled an interview with Professor Zharkova next week. Here is Professor Zharkova\u2019s paper, which summarises her team\u2019s years of research: This is the final part of the climate puzzle that, together with existing evidence of the primacy of solar cycles on earth\u2019s climate, effectively busts the global fraud.\nSurely, no one ever believed that King Canute could turn back the tide, or that mankind could change the climate? Those two delusions are just so, so similar.\nYet with the help of biddable scientists and media barons, this UN-sponsored fraud has endured for 30 years, to the present day.\nShame on us all!\n*John Rofe\u2019s vocation prior to retirement was as an internationally qualified Certified Management\nConsultant advising distressed organisations across many industry sectors.", "label": 1}, "dev-63": {"text": "The government must abandon its fossil fuel power projects. If not, we\u2019ll sue\nNo longer should our survival be an afterthought. If we are to withstand the climate crisis, every decision should begin with the question of what the planet can endure. This means that any discussion about new infrastructure should begin with ecological constraints. The figures are stark. A paper published in Nature last year showed that existing energy infrastructure, if it is allowed to run to the end of its natural life, will produce around 660 gigatonnes of CO2. Yet, to stand a reasonable chance of preventing more than 1.5\u00b0C of global heating, we can afford to release, in total, no more than 580 gigatonnes.\nIn other words, far from building new fossil power plants, the survival of a habitable planet means retiring the damaging projects that have already been built. Electricity plants burning coal and gas and oil will not secure our prosperity. They will destroy it.\nBut everywhere special interests dominate. Construction projects are driven, above all, by the lobbying of the construction industry, consultancies and financiers. Gigantic and destructive schemes, such as the Oxford-Cambridge Expressway, are invented by lobbyists for the purpose of generating contracts. Political support is drummed up, and the project achieves its own momentum; then, belatedly, a feeble attempt is made to demonstrate that it can somehow become compatible with environmental promises. This is what destroys civilisations: a mismatch between the greed of economic elites and the needs of society.\nBut last week something momentous happened. The decision to build a scheme with vast financial backing and terrible environmental impacts was struck down by the court of appeal. The judges decided that government policy, on which planning permission for a third runway at Heathrow was based, had failed to take account of the UK\u2019s climate commitments, and was therefore unlawful. This is \u2013 or should be \u2013 the end of business as usual.\nThe Heathrow decision stands as a massive and crucial precedent. Now we must use it to insist that governments everywhere put our survival first, and the demands of corporate lobbyists last. To this end, with the Good Law Project and Dale Vince, the founder of Ecotricity, I\u2019m pursuing a similar claim. In this case, we are challenging the UK government\u2019s policy for approving new energy projects.\nOn Tuesday, we delivered a \u201cletter before action\u201d to the Treasury solicitor. We\u2019ve given the government 21 days to accept our case and change its policy to reflect the climate commitments agreed by parliament. If it fails to do so, we shall issue proceedings in the high court to have the policy declared unlawful. We\u2019ll need money, so we\u2019ve launched a crowdfunding appeal to finance the action.\nIt\u2019s hard to see how the government could resist our case. The Heathrow judgment hung on the government\u2019s national policy statement on airports. This, the judges found, had not been updated to take account of the Paris climate agreement. New fossil fuel plants, such as the gas burners at Drax in Yorkshire the government approved last October, are enabled by something very similar: the national policy statements on energy infrastructure. These have not been updated since they were published in 2011. As a result, they take no account of the Paris agreement, of the government\u2019s new climate target (net zero by 2050, as opposed to an 80% cut) or of parliament\u2019s declaration of a climate emergency.\nThe main policy statement says that the EU Emissions Trading System \u201cforms the cornerstone of UK action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the power sector\u201d. As we have left the EU, this obviously no longer holds. The planning act obliges the government to review its national policy statements when circumstances change. It has failed to do so. It is disregarding its own laws.\nOnce a national policy statement has been published, there is little objectors can do to prevent damaging projects from going ahead, as the statements create a presumption in favour of new fossil fuel plants. In approving the Drax plant, Andrea Leadsom, the secretary of state for business and energy at the time, insisted that the policy statement came first, regardless of the climate impacts. Catastrophic decisions like this will continue to be made until the statements change. They are incompatible with either the government\u2019s new climate commitments or a habitable planet.\nWhile we are challenging the government\u2019s energy policies, another group \u2013 the Transport Action Network \u2013 is about to challenge its road-building schemes on the same basis. It points out that the national policy statement on road networks is also outdated and incompatible with the UK\u2019s climate commitments. The policy statement, astonishingly, insists that \u201cany increase in carbon emissions is not a reason to refuse development consent\u201d, unless the increase is so great that the road would prevent the government from meeting its national targets. No single road project can be disqualified on these grounds. But the cumulative effect of new road-building ensures that the UK will inevitably bust its carbon targets. While carbon emissions are officially disregarded, minuscule time savings on travel are used to justify massive and damaging projects.\nTransport emissions have been rising for the past five years, partly because of road-building. The government tries to justify its schemes by claiming that cars will use less fossil fuel. But because they are becoming bigger and heavier, new cars sold in the UK now produce more carbon dioxide per kilometre than older models.\nThe perverse and outdated national policy statement locks into place such damaging projects as the A303 works around Stonehenge, the A27 Arundel scheme, the Lower Thames crossing, the Port of Liverpool access road, the Silvertown tunnel in London and the Wensum link road in Norfolk. A government seeking to protect the lives of current and future generations would immediately strike down the policy that supports these projects, and replace it with one that emphasised walking, cycling and public transport.\nA third action has been launched by Chris Packham and the law firm Leigh Day, challenging HS2 on similar grounds. Its carbon emissions were not properly taken into account, and its environmental impacts were assessed before the government signed the Paris agreement.\nAlready, the Heathrow decision is resonating around the world.

The world is clearly not warming up as much as was forecast, this despite 2014 coming in as one of the warmest years ever recorded by the earth\u2019s scattered network of surface thermometers. In fact, during the past 18\u00a0years the earth\u2019s surface temperature has barely ticked up at all\u2014rising at a\u00a0rate some three time less than climate model projections. All the while the \u201cworse than expected\u201d claims attached to all manner of severe weather are being replaced by hard observations showing that \u201cthis isn\u2019t so bad after all.\u201d\nThat climate change will continue to be underwhelming and manageable is further supported by the growing body of scientific evidence that the Earth\u2019s surface temperature is considerably less sensitive to the build\u2010\u200bup of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere than advertised by the U.N.\u2019s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the U.S. Global Change Research Program and which is encapsulated in the President\u2019s executive actions on climate change.\n\nWhich brings us back to methane. According to the White House, the EPA is going to propose a\u00a0new set of regulations aimed at reducing its emissions from the oil and gas sector by 40\u201345 percent by 2025, in the name cutting down on \u201cwasted energy\u201d and \u201caddressing climate change\u201d to \u201chelp ensure a\u00a0cleaner, more stable environment for future generations.\u201d\nTime to apply a\u00a0little math to these propositions.\nMethane emissions from oil and gas operations have been on the decline thanks to new and improved technologies that reduce methane leakage during drilling, pumping, and processing operations. Methane emissions from this sector have dropped more than 10 percent since 2008. The president is correct about this being \u201cwasted energy\u201d\u2014because methane is in fact a\u00a0natural gas, so it makes sense for the industry to try and capture more and more of what they sell.\nWhy do we need to force industry to do what it wants to do anyway?\nOn the environmental side, we\u2019re sold the canard that methane is about 25 times more efficient than carbon dioxide at enhancing the greenhouse effect on a\u00a0molecule\u2010\u200bby\u2010\u200bmolecule basis. Sounds like a\u00a0big deal, no?\nIt\u2019s not. Carbon dioxide is measured in parts per million, methane in parts per billion. The difference between a\u00a0million and a\u00a0billion is 1000 million, making methane\u2019s allegedly more drastic effects inconsequential. Oil and gas methane comprises only about 3\u00a0percent of the total greenhouse effect changes coming from all US emissions.\nSo what would the President\u2019s proposed regulations do for global temperature?\nUsing the EPA\u2019s own policy model, it\u2019s easy to show that if the U.S. now and forever ceased emissions of\u00a0all\u00a0greenhouse gases, the amount of global warming that would be avoided would be about 0.15\u00b0C by the end of this century. Multiplying through the fact that the new regulations will reduce methane contribution from 3\u00a0percent down to 1.5 percent of this total, you can easily see that they will avert a\u00a0whopping 0.002\u00b0C of global warming by century\u2019s end.\nCoupling the ongoing downward emissions trajectory with the trifling climate impact makes the new EPA regulations on methane emissions senseless and unnecessary.\nThere\u2019s actually only one real reason for their announcement: to give the appearance of burnishing President Obama\u2019s climate change legacy and increasing his leverage during the year\u2010\u200bend United Nations climate talks in Paris aimed at producing a \u201clegally binding\u201d international treaty limiting greenhouse gas emissions\u2014a treaty which is not in our best interests and one which is most certainly destined to fail.", "label": 1}, "dev-65": {"text": "\u2018Climate Emergency\u2019 Fail of the Day \u2013 25\nAs the media have collaborated to bombard the populace with environmental and climate doom propaganda, it is only fair and reasonable to hold their feet to the fire (as it were) and examine past media promoted predictions that have failed to materialise.\nFrom \u00a0The Guardian, July 24, 2013\nDoubling down on the gone in eight years / gone in five years etc nonsense, the rhetoric was ramped up to gone in two years.\nA\u00a0new paper\u00a0in the journal Nature argues that the release of a 50 Gigatonne (Gt) methane pulse from thawing Arctic permafrost could destabilise the climate system and trigger costs as high as the value of the entire world\u2019s GDP.

Here we show that sediment cores drilled off Prins Karls Foreland contain freshwater from dissociating hydrates. However, our modeling indicates that the observed pore water freshening began around 8 ka BP when the rate of isostatic uplift outpaced eustatic sea-level rise. The resultant local shallowing and lowering of hydrostatic pressure forced gas hydrate dissociation and dissolved chloride depletions consistent with our geochemical analysis. Hence, we propose that hydrate dissociation was triggered by postglacial isostatic rebound rather than anthropogenic warming. Furthermore, we show that methane fluxes from dissociating hydrates were considerably smaller than present methane seepage rates implying that gas hydrates were not a major source of methane to the oceans, but rather acted as a dynamic seal, regulating methane release from deep geological reservoirs.", "label": 1}, "dev-66": {"text": "If You\u2019re Serious about Climate Change Jacinda You Need to Declare War on China\nOf course it\u2019s never going to happen and, for obvious reasons, not even she and her COL would be stupid enough to suggest such a thing, but if she is serious about stopping climate change (something humankind has never managed to achieve in the history of the planet \u2013 a bit like building 10,000 homes in ten years really) \u2013 China is the elephant in the room in more ways than one.\nChina is the world\u2019s largest emitter of CO2 by a long way, and our virtue signalling prime minister and her equally virtue signalling associates in parliament \u2013 including the National opposition \u2013 seem not to grasp that New Zealand\u2019s CO2 emissions will have as much effect on the planet as one individual peeing into the Pacific Ocean would have on changing the pH of the water.\nHow can it be that so many purportedly intelligent or at least knowledgeable people can be suckered by this unsubstantiated and baseless hoax, that started off as \u201cGlobal Warming\u201d sometime in the early to mid-1980s?\nWhen they realised that \u201cGlobal Warming\u201d was a hoax and it wasn\u2019t going to fly because sensible people kept challenging that concept, they changed it to \u201cClimate Change\u201d.

But the IPPR argues in its study that in order to do so ministers will have to loosen their own fiscal rules, which cap borrowing for investment at 3% of GDP annually.\nThe former Labour leader Ed Miliband, a co-chair of the IPPR\u2019s environmental justice commission, said the budget needed to put climate change at its heart.\n\u201cThis will take investment but making these decisions will create hundreds of thousands of jobs, improve our natural environment, cut air pollution and make Britain a better place to love,\u201d he said. \u201cIt makes economic and environmental sense.\u201d\nIn order to hit net zero within 30 years, the UK will need to be running on renewable energy with industry using mostly carbon-free processes.

The IPPR calculates it would need to spend an additional \u00a311bn just to meet that previous target.\nThe Green MP Caroline Lucas, another co-chair of the environmental justice commission said that the economic shock to the economy from the coronavirus made investment in the green economy even more necessary.\n\u201cThis budget will be a litmus test of whether the government understand the climate crisis, and on the basis of the evidence they are falling terrifyingly short of what is needed,\u201d Lucas said.\n\u201cWith likely shocks to the economy because of the coronavirus outbreak, and the accelerating climate emergency, investing in a green new deal is now more important than ever.\n\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t only help us address the climate and nature emergencies, it would transform almost every aspect of our economy and society and deliver on government promises to level up the nation by making our economy fairer and fit for the future.\u201d", "label": 0}, "dev-68": {"text": "With every flood, public anger over the climate crisis is surging\nSometimes it has felt as if the rain might never stop.\nThese storms have gone beyond the point of simply being storms now, each blurring into the next to create a strangely end-of-days feeling. Everything is freakishly sodden and swollen, and while the rural flood plain on which I live fortunately hasn\u2019t flooded anything like as badly as some, the rivers are rising alarmingly. Yet still the lashing winds and biblical downpours keep coming. Suddenly the 40 Days of Action campaign that Extinction Rebellion (XR) will launch on Ash Wednesday (26 February), encouraging people to reflect on the environmental consequences of their actions in a kind of green Lent, feels ominously well named.\nThis week\u2019s stunt in Cambridge, where XR activists dug up Trinity College\u2019s lawn in symbolic protest at the college\u2019s plans to build on land it owns in rural Suffolk, may be just the beginning. Some ask why these activists aren\u2019t out stacking sandbags for the poor householders of the Wye valley, or canoeing through the streets of Mytholmroyd, West Yorkshire, highlighting the risks of a climate crisis that can only mean more freak flooding.\nYet in some ways that was the point of targeting Trinity in the first place. Of all the Cambridge colleges, it\u2019s the one identified by student journalists \u2013 using freedom of information requests \u2013 as the biggest investor in fossil fuel companies blamed for aggravating the climate crisis. Activists blockaded a research building run by the oil exploration company Schlumberger as well as making holes in the lawn. The clear aim is to make it toxic for institutions to maintain ties to polluting industries; and what makes universities tempting targets is that they\u2019re already being hammered from inside by students raging against what they see as dirty money.\nBut universities are not alone. This week Amazon chief Jeff Bezos announced he was giving $10bn (\u00a37.7bn) to fight the climate crisis, provoking much the same complaints that greeted BP\u2019s recent vow to go carbon-neutral by 2050: it\u2019s not enough, it\u2019s too vague, it\u2019s just greenwashing. And yes, obviously Bezos should tackle his own company\u2019s carbon footprint first, not to mention treating staff better and paying more tax if he has billions to spare. But until governments have the guts to legislate for all of that, then we are where we are, which is in danger of missing a sea change in corporate life.\nExecutives in polluting industries haven\u2019t quite reached the nadir of bankers after the financial crash, cold-shouldered at school gates and berated in the street, but the more enlightened can see something similar coming if they\u2019re not careful. When BP\u2019s new chief executive, Bernard Looney, made his carbon neutral announcement, following a similar pledge from British Airways, one key factor cited was pressure from staff. It hurts when your company is spurned by the likes of the Royal Shakespeare Company, which ended its sponsorship deal with BP last year amid climate protests, not long after the actor Mark Rylance compared the firm to an arms dealer or tobacco company. At Amazon, too, Bezos had felt the heat internally with hundreds of staff protesting publicly against the company\u2019s links to oil and gas exploration.\nAnd if younger staff are making waves now, then the climate will be an even harder red line for the graduates these companies need to recruit in future. Two-thirds of American teens now think oil and gas companies create more problems in the world than they solve, according to a report from management consultants EY. Generation Z want to work for ethical companies that make them feel good about themselves, and increasingly see jobs that fuel climate change as morally suspect. Who wants to spend a first date plaintively explaining why working in Big Oil doesn\u2019t make them a bad person?\nIt may sound ridiculous to their parents\u2019 generation, for whom energy companies were the ones keeping the lights on, but even those with no such qualms must wonder if there\u2019s much future with fossil fuel companies \u2013 squeezed between the political rock of legal commitments to hit zero emissions by 2050 and a public hard place that gets harder with every flood or bush fire.\nIt\u2019s not consumer boycotts driving this, so much as social stigma. It\u2019s tough to go without these companies\u2019 products \u2013 there was outrage when a bursar at St John\u2019s College, Oxford, responded to student demands to divest immediately from fossil fuels with a tongue-in-cheek offer to turn their heating off if they were that worried \u2013 although the intention was to make the students think, not freeze. But noisy public disapproval costs absolutely nothing, which makes it a powerful weapon.\nAdd in shareholder pressure, driven by new government rules requiring pension funds to take account of climate risk, and the heat is really on. Suddenly Bezos\u2019s gesture starts to look positively cheap in comparison with being forced to change his business model. Yet, whatever the motivation, it\u2019s still one of the biggest philanthropic donations in recent history, and it shows which way a howling wind is blowing.\nHow to spend those billions? Bill and Melinda Gates argued this month that private philanthropists should be \u201cswinging for the fences\u201d, taking the big risks governments can\u2019t take with public money. So perhaps the Bezos fund will simply go on a few high-profile scientific gambles.\nBut the radical choice would be to spend some of it funding movements within corporate and institutional life, pushing the foot-draggers to act while they\u2019re still in control of the situation. Better to move fast than wait for activists to dig up your lawn; better to act now, before the river of public anger bursts its banks.\n\u2022 Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnist", "label": 0}, "dev-69": {"text": "Collection of Vladimir Putin's most notable speeches published\nThe time when every Russian politician\u2019s bookshelf was expected to contain the 55-volume complete works of Vladimir Lenin has long gone, but the country\u2019s political elite have been gifted a slimline alternative this holiday season.

However, once the former hit a tipping point, they collapse relatively faster because failures repeat throughout their modular structure. As a result, the bigger the ecosystem, the harder it is likely to fall.\nBased on their statistical analysis, the authors estimate an ecosystem the size of the Amazon (approximately 5.5m km2) could collapse in approximately 50 years once a tipping point had been reached.

You\u2019d rather not come up with such a set of results,\u201d he said.\nA separate study last week warned the Amazon could shift within the next decade into a source of carbon emissions rather than a sink, because of damage caused by loggers, farmers and global heating.\nExperts said the new findings should be a spur to action.\n\u201cI think the combination of theory, modelling and observations is especially persuasive in this paper, and should alert us to risks from human activities that perturb the large and apparently stable ecosystems upon which we depend,\u201d said Georgina Mace, professor of biodiversity and ecosystems at University College London, who was not involved in the studies.\n\u201cThere are effective actions that we can take now, such as protecting the existing forest, managing it to maintain diversity, and reducing the direct pressures from logging, burning, clearance and climate change.\u201d\nThese views were echoed by Ima Vieira, an ecologist at Museu Em\u00edlio Goeldi in Bel\u00e9m, Brazil. \u201cThis is a very important paper. For Brazil to avoid the ecosystem collapse modelled in this study, we need to strengthen governance associated to imposing heavy fines on companies with dirty supply chains, divestment strategies targeting key violators and enforcement of existing laws related to environmental crimes. And we have to be quick.\u201d\nHowever, the methodology was not universally accepted. Erika Berenguer, a senior research associate at the University of Oxford and Lancaster University, said the regime shifts paper relied too much on data from lakes and oceans to be useful as an indicator of what would happen to rainforests.\n\u201cWhile there is no doubt the Amazon is at great risk and that a tipping point is likely, such inflated claims do not help either science or policy making,\u201d she said.\nThe authors said their study was not a forecast about a specific region but a guide to the speed at which change could occur.", "label": 0}, "dev-72": {"text": "Australia\u2019s Already HAD a \u2018Climate Change\u2019 Election\nAt the height of Australia\u2019s bushfire crisis, what did tens of thousands of Greens voters across the country do? Had they ever put their hands up to volunteer as firefighters? Were they at staging grounds, dishing out breakfasts alongside the ladies of the Country Women\u2019s Association (after all, the CWA has been subject to a concerted push from urban greens recently)? Were they doing anything useful at all?\nWhy, no \u2013 they were out in the inner cities, tying up precious police resources, as they stamped their little feets and held their little bweafs, protesting a democratic election result.\nThe Green-left\u2019s sore-loser temper-tantrums are as predictable as they are selfish and anti-democratic, which is why it\u2019s all the more important for the government not to be spooked into submission.\nSenior Coalition figures have been discussing how to bolster the government\u2019s environmental credentials to address a growing tide of voters in blue-ribbon Liberal seats who want stronger action on \u00adclimate change.\nThe shift emerged in the May 2019 election and the bushfire crisis, even if not directly related to Australia\u2019s own carbon emissions, will make that conversation more urgent.\nYes, the Liberals lost some inner-city seats, some formerly blue-ribbon Liberal.

The study it reports is actually pretty good, but the report is atrocious. There is an important message here, because the topic is climate change, which is arguably the most political scientific debate in history. This is spin over science.\n\n\nThe study is a modest survey of middle and high school science teachers, about 1500 in all, conducted by the Penn State Survey Research Center. Unlike prior surveys, this one involves a lot of selection of respondents and weighting of responses. The goal is to match the small sample to the actual demographics of American education. It is an elaborate and interesting process but this has nothing to do with the questions asked in the survey, which is where the spin comes in.\nThey apparently ask two kinds of questions. (Strangely, the survey questions are not provided in the online Supplementary Materials.)\n\nThe first are procedural questions. These have do with such things as whether global warming is included in the curriculum and if so, how much time is taken, how much the debate is discussed, etc. The findings are that global warming is widely discussed, but typically for just a\u00a0few class sessions. This makes sense because the issue is widely known, but the science curriculum is very crowded.\nThen there apparently are a\u00a0bunch of questions about the teacher. This is a\u00a0bit murky but the focus seems to be how much the teacher knows about the global warming issues and what they think about them. This is where the spin begins.\nThe problem is that the authors are proponents of the dogmatic view that there is a \u2018consensus\u2019 within science, according to which humans are the dominant cause of (dangerous) global warming. The problem with that synthesis is evident in any graph showing global surface average temperature since 1900, shown above.\nThere\u2019s clearly a\u00a0substantial warming early in the 20th\u00a0Century, roughly from 1910 to 1945. This was largely before the major emissions of carbon dioxide, which commenced with the War, so that\u2019s not likely to be caused by human activity. The second period of warming, from the late 1970s through the late 90s is of similar magnitude and certainly does have some characteristics that would largely (though not completely) associate it with emissions, but it cannot be distinguished in magnitude from the earlier warming (Note the spikes in 1998 and 2015 are caused by strong El Ni\u00f1o events. Because of that, it is not clear that the world has indeed resumed warming at the previous rate.)\nThe bottom line is\u2014given the caveat about 2015\u2014it would appear that as much warming occurred naturally as could be attributed to human activity.\nThe authors of the\u00a0Science\u00a0paper ignore this. When they found that many teachers do not agree and are teaching that a\u00a0substantial component of global warming may be natural, they went on a\u00a0bit of a\u00a0rhetorical rampage, accusing the teachers of being ignorant and confused.\nThis grossly unscientific behavior is probably explained by the presence of the National Center for Science Education. NCSE is a\u00a0political activist organization, not a\u00a0science shop. They are strident proponents of the dogmatic \u2018consensus\u2019 view. It appears that NCSE funded this study, plus providing three of the five co\u2010\u200bauthors. So no wonder it is stridently political.\nIn short, the title \u201cclassroom confusion\u201d is a\u00a0political statement, not a\u00a0scientific finding. Much of the article is similarly political. Science should not have published this article, because it is not science. The scientific finding is that the climate debate is alive and well in the classroom, as it is in the nation. This is good news.\nNot surprisingly, reports have amplified the article\u2019s error. For example, a\u00a0Washington Post\u00a0article\u00a0on this study begins with the title: \u201cHow teachers are getting it wrong on climate change.\u201d The very first sentence then claims that the idea that global warming may be a\u00a0natural process is an \u201cincorrect idea.\u201d It\u2019s very clear from the data shown above that a\u00a0substantial portion indeed is\u00a0not\u00a0because of carbon dioxide emissions.\nRather than being settled, the question of how much of global warming is due to human activity, and how much is from other causes is still unanswered. Teachers who recognize this are hardly espousing an \u201cincorrect idea.\u201d", "label": 1}, "dev-74": {"text": "Facebook, Groupon, Netflix Drive the Next Big Thing and America\u2019s Economic Resurgence\nThe 2011 Consumer Electronics Show (CES) was abuzz with wireless broadband \u2013 the unfettered Internet, released from the bondage of desktop computing. Most of the news focus and appetite for devices and bandwidth is driven by social networking and video-everywhere. Hot, hot, hot. Maybe the next Big Thing. Big enough to inspire Qualcomm\u2019s [NASDAQ: QCOM] pricey $3 billion acquisition of wireless chipmaker Atheros [NASDAQ: ATHR]. Maybe hot enough to drive another Silicon Valley dot-com-like investment frenzy. Witness the stratospheric valuations and expectations for still-private Facebook and Groupon as iconic faces of social-networking. But something more fundamental is going on. Not to stretch a well-worn analogy, but focusing on the social and entertainment industry in this context is akin to focusing on vacation travel as the chief economic benefit enabled by the 1950s construction of interstate highways. Obviously the new highways (plus cheap automobiles) spawned a huge tourism industry, but that was a side benefit. Construction jobs abounded too during the highway construction phase, but that new system provided economic value far broader and longer lasting, virtually reshaping America. Analogies are imperfect, but we are today experiencing a comparable infrastructure build-out, with comparable implications. It\u2019s just much less visible than tarmac and engines. The pleasing functionality of smart-phones, touch-screen tablets, and lightning-fast desktops is enabled by another combinatorial infrastructure \u2014 mating cheap and blazingly fast wired and wireless Internet \u2018superhighway\u2019 with thousands of leviathan-scale data centers. The latter is what Google engineers are calling \u201cwarehouse-scale computing.\u201d When you can have fast real-time anywhere connections to ubiquitous logic and storage, the device in your hand doesn\u2019t have to be so smart to appear brilliant. The heavy lifting is done elsewhere, in what has come to be known as The Cloud. The early Cloud feeders, much the darlings of CES chatter \u2013 Twitter, Zynga, Netflix [NASDAQ: NFLX] and many others yet to appear \u2013 are essentially entertainment and social plays. Certainly a Big Thing for some investors. But in and of themselves such companies are not the next Big Thing our economy needs to re-ignite. True, social-network-type capabilities can improve businesses productivity \u2014 LinkedIn and Salesforce.com [NYSE: CRM] come to mind. Important but largely incremental at the macroeconomic level. Our eye should be on the underlying infrastructure explosion that enables social networking and video everywhere. The unprecedented adoption rate for wireless broadband, epitomized and led by Apple\u2019s [NASDAQ: AAPL] iPhone and iPad, drives and funds the massive expansion of the Cloud. The Cloud\u2019s wireless connectivity and computing power are practically free. Measured in inflation-adjusted terms, wireless bandwidth and computation are a million-fold cheaper than in 1970. George Gilder gets credit for years ago predicting that bandwidth would become free. It\u2019s the catalytic combination of free bandwidth with free computation that brings on a new era. It may not be actually free (just pretty amazingly cheap) to stream an episode of \u201cGlee\u201d to your Android phone, mainly because that activity alone consumes more bandwidth and computing power than the entire telephone network of a small city circa 1970. But if what you want to do is make a phone call itself \u2013 which uses an infinitesimal amount of bandwidth and computing power \u2013 - that is essentially free. (Hence the migration of phone companies away from a voice-based revenue model.) And if your call required an even smaller share of the highway than voice, then the real cost does approach nothing. That\u2019s the reason companies like OnStar and mbrace can add for practically nothing features such as door unlock, and baby-cams can add features such as room-temperature monitoring. The massive ubiquitousness of the new wireless-plus-Cloud infrastructure makes it practically free to connect things, and information about things. Things like thermostats and toll booths, brake pads or crates of bananas. There is no official definition for the Internet of Things. But in simplest terms it is when things and objects, or parts of things instead of people, initiate communication and are networked. It\u2019s when your car, via EZpass, tells a toll-booth where you are and to charge your bank account $2.50. It\u2019s when your home thermostat sends information to you, or a shipping pallet of refrigerated pharmaceuticals alerts shipping-and-receiving of condition and time-of-arrival, or when your brake pads tell not just you but the dealer\u2019s warehouse and the manufacturer, that you need new pads. It\u2019s when the trucks for a fleet manager, and customers and producers, keeps real-time tabs on location, fuel-use, and on every pallet and even every box on the pallet. When a farmer\u2019s field knows by the square-meter where more or less water or fertilizer are needed. Also when the manual push-button help-I-fell-and-can\u2019t-get-up monitor becomes location and position smart, and automatically alerts all relevant parties to Gramps\u2019 fall, location, heart-rate and blood pressure. In short, any thing that has a condition of interest to someone, somewhere, can be accessed in principal now, or very soon, cost effectively, in real time. At the most basic level, most conditions of interest are rather simple: on/off, here/there, hot/cold, ready/stopped, fast/slow, far/close, thin/thick. And one small level up are metrics such as speed, temperature, height, location, and energy use. All these have value in every domain of human activity, e.g., in manufacturing, services, entertainment, travel, the environment, health care. And each piece of information about some thing requires trivial communications bandwidth, so that case-by-case the use of wireless access is practically free. And with the Cloud, the use of capacious computing power to add intelligence to the object is nearly free too. So the emergence and acceleration of the Cloud driven by Facebook and its cousins and progeny now enable the Internet of Things because the capabilities are so broad in scope and scale, and the per-byte costs are so low as to be free. As an historical aside, credit for the phrase, if not the idea of the Internet of Things belongs it appears to engineer Kevin Ashton who may have been the first to coin the phrase in a 1999 presentation presciently envisioning the network of objects, not people. It bears noting that Ashton is today General Manager of Belkin Conserve, after that company\u2019s April 2010 acquisition of Zensi, an energy sensing/monitoring company Ashton founded. Credit probably belongs to Michael Chui, senior fellow at McKinsey Global Institute, for articulating the fundamental sensor-centric metrics of this new era. The concept has spawned an entire subculture of research, investment, conferences and even an Internet of Things Council. Why should anyone care? Much of the inefficiency \u2013 - the inverse of productivity \u2013 in what we build, fabricate, grow, move and use resides in what we don\u2019t know, what we have to prepare for. Information has value. There is more value in the information about the location of a shipping container than the cost of the steel to build that container. The scope of the information of value is nearly beyond imagination. It has been said that every human is surrounded by 100 to 1,000 objects. That apocryphal statistic undercounts reality, since it\u2019s not what surrounds us individually, but what constitutes the universe of things we care about on the planet, from the health of a fruit tree in some remote orchard, to the health of an industrial bearing in a critical pump in a remote oil field, or critical joints in a bridge, the state of roads, or state of your suit at the laundry. The number trillions doesn\u2019t come close to counting the potential points of information. The growth of the Internet of Things starts by connecting existing sensors. This trend underpins, for example, the emerging utility smart-grid with its hundreds of millions of existing sensors and switches. It also the trend in vehicle and engine diagnostics added to the real-time uplinks for fleet vehicles \u2013 and in things like the aforementioned enhanced baby-cam. At the moment, the Internet of Things is still only marginally significant. Gartner has estimated that sensors will shortly account for about 20 percent of non-video Internet traffic. The next step involves the creation of entire new classes of sensors \u2013 since piggy-backing the free networked Cloud effectively and radically reduces the total system cost to just that of the sensor. So how cheap can we make new sensors to put them where they\u2019ve never been before \u2013 from under the farmer\u2019s field to under your skin? Easy to answer: the trend will follow the still collapsing cost, and power appetite, of silicon-based devices \u2014 Moore\u2019s Law. And ever lower power matters, since energy always matters. The talk is of \u201csmart dust.\u201d But because the smarts are in the Cloud, the challenge is made easier since all you really need is dust that can sense, and talk. Low-power sensors can use imbedded cell-phone chips powered by micro-batteries to episodically transmit kilobytes of data with operating lifespans of weeks, useful for many shipping domains, or human-centric activity. Even lower power millimeter-scale sensors are already in development that require mere picowatts of power. At these levels \u2013 a jumping flea can generate thousands of picowatts \u2014 you can scavenge energy needed from vibrations or heat in the ambient environment, and even from the pervasive existence of radio waves themselves. For the potential scale of the Internet of Things one should count sensors since some things may contain several to thousands of sensors. Each of America\u2019s 100 million homes contain hundreds of sensing points. So too each of the 200 million vehicles on the road, and the 70 billion square feet of commercial office space. There are dozens of relevant sensors points within each of the hundreds of millions of cell phones and similar. Then count trucks, trains, aircraft, factories, fields, farms and the list goes on. The total Internet traffic from all these sensors? Consider the math. A billion people using a video-level megbatye of network bandwidth yields a million-billion, or petabyte, of activity. A trillion sensors each piggy-backing the network using a mere kilobyte of bandwidth is also a petabyte. And in many cases the sensors will \u2018talk\u2019 more often. The Internet of Things creates unprecedented capabilities for every aspect of an economy\u2019s function. And while building it out will create jobs, and investment opportunities for both the businesses who make and deploy the hardware, software and services, in the long-run the biggest winner will be the U.S. economy as the new and largely unanticipatable features and benefits of this radical infrastructure upgrade take hold enhancing efficiency and productivity, these being the essential drivers of economic growth, always and everywhere. The 1950s highway system had the same effect. The evolution of the Internet has undergone two main phases thus far, epitomized by the most common things it was used for. First came email. Then came shopping, news and static entertainment. Now comes video. Next comes things. Each earlier phase drove a boom in demand and construction of networks and the back-office hardware (data centers) \u2013 each time in a typical boom-bust cycle. And each phase was also associated with, and contributed significantly to, underlying American economic growth. Thus far, the creation and growth of each phase of the Internet has been dominantly associated with American enterprise. It can continue to be thus \u2014 assuming some reasonably sensible behavior on the legislative front (largely staying out of the way) \u2014 because the nature and growth of each phase of the Internet has been unpredictable, semi-chaotic, tech-centric and entrepreneurial driven. All the hallmark features of the American scene. Returning to the high-level bellwethers \u2013 Intel [NASDAQ: INTC] has voted on the wireless-Cloud infrastructure trend with their summer 2010 $1.4 billion acquisition of Infineon\u2019s wireless chip business. Intel\u2019s CEO Otellini said the addition of computing power and Internet connections to smart phones, tablets and the like is \u201cchanging them and changing the world.\u201d It will change more than phones and tablets. And it will change America first, then the world \u2013 if we don\u2019t mess up. More recently, and contemporaneously with the CES 2011, Qualcomm\u2019s announcement of a record-setting $3 billion acquisition of wireless chip-maker Atheros is already heralded as an early bellwether for an unleashing of corporate cash hordes. All true. But the back story points to another cycle of American tech resurgence. Explaining the acquisition, Qualcomm CEO Irwin Jacobs said \u201cAll sorts of stuff is going to get connected. \u2026It\u2019s probably the theme of the next five to 10 years in the industry.\u201d He doesn\u2019t know the half of it. But then, maybe he does given Jacob\u2019s track record. The Internet of Things enables the rise of the machines \u2013 but unlike the hyperbolic Hollywood movie of the same phrase, this rise will enable and free humans to do more, produce more, and ultimately become healthier and wealthier.<>", "label": 0}, "dev-75": {"text": "How to Solve the Climate Crisis\nIt\u2019s the weekend, and so I have decided to give you all a break from the doom and gloom that we seem to be facing on a daily basis, and instead enlighten you all on award-winning journalist, Verity Johnson\u2019s solution to the ragged subject of climate emergencies. She has the solution; buy a KeepCup.\nShe even seems to think that this is the solution to being a feminist as\nwell. And no\u2026 it is not April 1st. I seem to say that a lot these days, don\u2019t\nI?\nI\u2019ll be honest, I\u2019ve never been overly concerned about environmentalism.It\u2019s not like I wanted to douse the planet in napalm, I just haven\u2019t ever really been an environmental type. I was put off easily and early on by the stereotypes around environmental activists, all of whom I knew were more earnest than an American Christian summer camp leader,\u00a0and used lemons as deodorant.\u00a0And honestly, I just never really thought about it much more than that. Yeah, I recycled and bought carbon offsetting on flights, but my efforts probably never amounted to more than spitting on a house fire.\nFor a Stuff journalist to be saying all that, expect to be lectured on how this is totally the wrong way of thinking. Expect Verity to reveal how she has now seen the light \u2013 Hallelujah! \u2013 and how we sinners must all do so too.\nHowever, all of that changed when my office reacted with outrage to the news that\u00a0Wellington City Council is refusing to recycle \u201ccompostable\u201d coffee cups. We\u2019re a KeepCup? office.\nHow absolutely environmental of you, Verity. A KeepCup office indeed. I had no idea this was how to save the world. You really are an inspiration.\nIt just so happens that I\u2019m also the resident caffeine junkie, who at any one point will be surrounded by a sea of half-empty, non-recyclable coffee-stained cylinders of imminent turtle death. And so in the climate of office-based outrage, it was collectively decided this week that I needed to change. A jury was called at the watercooler, and I had to explain myself \u2026My problem has been that environmentalism has never been my cause.\nSo you keep saying, Verity. I get it. You were not an environmentalist\u2026 until suddenly, you were.\nI have a theory that everyone has their one cause. One thing they get really, really het up over, which provides an endless well of outrage and energy to draw upon and fuels them to do all the campaigning, donating and small everyday life changes that add up to significant change.\u00a0 We all have one big cause we\u2019re willing to die on a rock for, like a morally outraged Prometheus.\u00a0Mine\u2019s always been feminism\u00a0(closely followed by the exploitation of vulnerable people).\u00a0For a lot of people, it\u2019s animal abuse. And, for the watercooler witch trial, it\u2019s takeaway coffee cups.\nSigh. Not only is this going to be a climate crisis lecture, it is going to be a long winded one too.\nAnd when you\u2019re like me (chaotic, last-minute and with an appalling grasp of time), it\u2019s easy to drown out the vague traces of guilt about taking Ubers everywhere with, \u201cBut I\u2019m too late to wait for the bus!\u201d Likewise I always justify takeaway cups by reasoning that I\u2019d never remember to carry a KeepCup/wash it/not smash it like I have the last five phones I\u2019ve had these past 12 months.\nYou know what? I really hate people who talk about \u2018first world problems\u2019, but this is the worst case of first world problems that I have ever encountered. Having to take an Uber\u2026 not being able to remember a KeepCup. For goodness sake\u2026\nI tried explaining all of these things to the cardigan-clad office judiciary. But midway through I heard myself saying, \u201cI just don\u2019t think it\u2019s my responsibility given that 100 multinationals have been responsible for 70 per cent of the world\u2019s carbon emissions \u2026 besides, what impact will one individual have \u2026\u201d\u00a0Not only was I denying my individual responsibility in upholding a damaging system. But I was also downplaying my role in being able to help solve it. I sounded exactly like your average anti-feminist.\nI am still trying to figure out where feminism fits into this. Being unenvironmental, or unable to handle the massive issues involved with a KeepCup surely must apply pretty much equally to men and women. It seems not.\nThe environment isn\u2019t my great inflaming passion, but I can see how, as an individual, I\u2019ve got responsibility in climate change and should therefore do more to create change. At least to avoid being a glaring hypocrite who asked others to make small changes to things they didn\u2019t really care about, but didn\u2019t do it myself.\nSo you keep saying. Verity. Just one thing though. Climate crises, if they exist (which I doubt) affect men and women equally, whereas feminism advantages only women. They are not comparable in any shape or form.\nAnd yes, swearing off takeaway cups is a tiny action. But just in the same way that standing up for someone who\u2019s being sexually harassed at the office can be life-changing, it\u2019s the spending choices of everyday consumers that dictate the habits of big companies \u2013 look at the popularity of free-range products.\nSo I bought a KeepCup. Two, actually. And now I couldn\u2019t call myself a feminist without it.\nWell, I am aghast. Buying a KeepCup makes you both an environmentalist and a feminist.

According to some eco-warriors, all that\u2019s necessary is to end capitalism \u2014 the one economic system that has lifted billions from poverty and suffering.\n\nThe latest United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report led Eric Holthaus, a Grist writer, to tweet enthusiastically, \u201cThe world\u2019s top scientists just gave rigorous backing to systematically dismantle capitalism as a key requirement to maintaining civilization and a habitable planet.\u201d\n\nThe sentiment is not new. Three years ago, while pushing for the Paris Climate Accord, U.N. climate official Christiana Figueres described the strategy this way: \u201cThis is the first time in the history of mankind that we are setting ourselves the task of intentionally, within a defined period of time, to change the economic development model that has been reigning for at least 150 years, since the Industrial Revolution.\u201d\nTo accomplish such a feat, the new IPCC report proposes an energy tax of epic proportions. It claims that, to keep warming in check, by 2030 we\u2019ll need to impose a tax of between $135 and $5,500 on every ton of carbon emitted. And that\u2019s just for starters. By the end of the century, the authors say, we\u2019ll have to jack the tax up to as much as $27,000 per ton.\n\nHow would that play out in the real world, where conventional carbon-emitting fuels currently generate about 80 percent of all energy consumed? Carbon taxes of the magnitude suggested in the IPCC report would bankrupt families and businesses and trigger a global economic disaster.\n\nUsing the same model as the federal government\u2019s Energy Information Administration, Heritage analysts estimated the economic impacts of a $37 per ton carbon tax \u2014 less than a third of the IPCC\u2019s lowest recommendation. The model indicates that, at $37 per ton, the tax would reduce U.S. aggregate gross domestic product by more than $2.5 trillion over the next 17 years. That translates to more than $21,000 in lost income, per family. It would also destroy more than a million jobs, half of them in energy-intensive manufacturing sectors.\n\nThe higher the tax goes, the greater the economic damage. At $135 per ton, the model crashes. These costs are far higher than most Americans are willing to pay. According to a poll from the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago and the AP-NORC Center for Public Research Affairs, only a little more than half of us would shell out as much as a buck a month to reduce carbon emissions. At $20 a month, the poll found, only 27 percent of the public is willing to pay to combat climate change. Even among households earning more than $100,000, only 46 percent were willing to pay as much as $20 a month.\n\nFor zealous eco-warriors eager to impose far more expensive carbon taxes, that\u2019s not very encouraging.\n\n\nAnd it\u2019s bound to be doubly discouraging when they consider that these polls failed to mention that, while high taxes would destroy the globe\u2019s economic system, they would produce virtually no \u201cclimate benefit\u201d at all.\n\nIn the developing world, more than 1.4 billion people still suffer from energy poverty. The IPCC report means nothing to them. Their priority is gaining access to energy and the economic growth it allows. They will continue to increase their greenhouse gas emissions, no matter how loudly the IPCC sirens blare.\n\nYes, developing countries are spending money on green technologies, but they\u2019re also building a lot of new coal plants. The current and projected use of fossil fuels, including coal, almost certainly guarantees that the report\u2019s reduction targets won\u2019t be met through some massive energy overhaul.\n\nScreaming that the sky is falling hasn\u2019t worked well for climate activists in the past, and there\u2019s little evidence that will change. Offering solutions to climate change that would require a complete makeover of the global economy and plunge developed nations into deprivation are unrealistic and counterproductive.", "label": 1}, "dev-78": {"text": "This winter in Europe was hottest on record by far, say scientists\nThis winter has been by far the hottest recorded in Europe, scientists have announced, with the climate crisis likely to have supercharged the heat.\nThe EU\u2019s Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) data dates back to 1855. It said the average temperature for December, January and February was 1.4C above the previous winter record, which was set in 2015-16. New regional climate records are usually passed by only a fraction of a degree. Europe\u2019s winter was 3.4C hotter than the average from 1981-2010.\nThe unseasonal heat has led to the failure of the ice-wine harvest in Germany and snow having to be imported for sporting events in Sweden and Russia. In Helsinki, Finland, the average temperature for January and February was more than 6C higher than the 1981-2010 average. In the UK, serious flooding is likely to have been made worse by higher temperatures, as in 2015.\n\u201cWhilst this winter was a truly extreme event in its own right, it is likely that these sorts of events have been made more extreme by the global warming trend,\u201d said Carlo Buontempo, director of C3S.\nBut he added: \u201cSeeing such a warm winter is disconcerting, but does not represent a climate trend as such. Seasonal temperatures, especially outside the tropics vary significantly from year to year.\u201d\nNonetheless, scientists expect global heating to increase the number of temperature extremes and this is continuing around the world. Australia, which has suffered catastrophic bushfires, has just recorded its second-hottest summer on record, only a little cooler than the record set the year before.\nIn Antarctica, the temperature rose above 20C for the first time on record in February, almost a full degree higher than the previous record set in 1982.\nAcross the globe as a whole, 2019 was the second hottest on record for the planet\u2019s surface and both the past five years and the past decade were the hottest in 150 years. The previous hottest year was in 2016, but temperatures were boosted that year by a natural El Ni\u00f1o event. The heat in the world\u2019s oceans reached a new record level in 2019, showing \u201cirrefutable and accelerating\u201d heating of the planet, according to scientists.\nIn the UK, the Met Office said in January that a series of high temperature records were broken in 2019 as a consequence of the climate crisis. This included the hottest temperature ever recorded in the country: 38.7C on 25 July in Cambridge.\n2020 is a crucial year in the fight to halt the climate emergency and prevent the damaging impacts worsening.

The report focuses on EU countries and was produced for the Tapp Coalition of health, environment and animal welfare organisations. It says \u201cfair pricing\u201d for meat should be included in the forthcoming European \u201cgreen new deal\u201d and so-called farm to fork strategy.\nThe report, produced by environmental research group CE Delft, analysed the costs of greenhouse gas emissions, other air and water pollution, and losses of wildlife associated with livestock production. It estimated that covering these costs would increase the price of beef by \u20ac0.47 (40p) per 100g. This would increase the cost of a 227g supermarket steak in the UK by about 25%.\nThe levy on pork and chicken would be lower owing to their smaller environmental impact, at \u20ac0.36 (31p)/100g and \u20ac0.17 (14p)/100g respectively. The report suggests such charges could reduce consumption of beef in the EU by 67%, pork by 57% and chicken by 30% by 2030.\nAs well as reducing emissions by 120m tonnes a year, the charges would raise \u20ac32bn a year for EU member states, according to the report.\nThe Tapp Coalition said about half of this should be given to help farmers move their production away from meat, which could increase individual farm incomes by thousands of euros per year.\nThe rest should be used to reduce the cost of fruit and vegetables, support poorer families and help developing countries deal with the climate crisis.\nJeroom Remmers, a Tapp Coalition director, said: \u201cEuropeans eat roughly 50% more meat than is recommended in dietary health guidelines. [So] we could also save billions of euros every year in lower healthcare costs.\u201d\nIn November, three European health associations wrote to Frans Timmermans, the senior European commissioner leading the green new deal initiative. They said: \u201cNumerous studies in recent years have shown that a shift to healthy, more plant-rich diets can deliver important health, environmental and economic benefits.\u201d\nA carbon tax on high-impact food is also backed by a second report, from the Behavioural Insights Team (Bit), a social purpose company part-owned by the UK government. It further suggests making plant-based food the default choice at catered events or on flights.\nRecent research has shown that a huge reduction in meat-eating in rich nations is essential to tackle the climate emergency. Other work indicates that avoiding meat and dairy products is the single biggest way to reduce your environmental impact on the planet.\n\u201cIncluding the environmental cost of animal protein in the price is a crucial element of meeting EU targets for climate, biodiversity, public health, and animal welfare,\u201d said Prof Pier Vellinga at Wageningen University in the Netherlands and chair of the Tapp Coalition.\nThe report from Bit, also known as the \u201cnudge unit\u201d set up by David Cameron in 2010, examines how governments, the food industry and campaign groups can help shift diets away from meat.\nAs well as supporting a carbon tax on high-impact food, it says governments could lead by example, by \u201cremoving or reducing unsustainable foods from public canteens in hospitals, schools and government offices\u201d. It also says practical cooking skills could be taught in schools and colleges.\nFood companies could make plant-based products the default choice, for example at catered events or on flights, the Bit report said. It also suggested marketing plant-based food as \u201cdelicious, normal, and satisfying, not as light, abstemious, or overtly healthy or vegetarian\u201d. Another proposal is placing veggie burgers alongside their meat counterparts instead of separating them on menus or in supermarket aisles.\nThe report said campaign groups could reduce the perceived complexity of sustainable eating by promoting clear rules of thumb, such as \u201cred meat\u2019s a treat\u201d.\nToby Park, the head of energy and sustainability at Bit, said: \u201cGovernments, industry and consumers around the world are more aware than ever of the need to live within our planet\u2019s means.\n\u201cWhile some of the solutions will come from technical advancements, there is huge potential and need to reduce our environmental impacts with some simple behaviour changes.\u201d\nIn the UK, the National Farmers\u2019 Union says agriculture can become climate neutral by 2040 without cutting beef production. Instead, it says three-quarters of farming emissions can be offset by growing fuel for power stations and then capturing and burying the carbon dioxide.", "label": 0}, "dev-81": {"text": "Winston Steps into Climate Row\nDarling Jacinda. She has never met a high horse she cannot preach from, and she never misses an opportunity to insult our closest neighbours. Doing her bit for the planet by wearing the same dreadful boots that she has worn for the past 2 years has given Jacinda the right to lecture the Australians about climate change, even though her own carbon footprint has been truly woeful lately. Our record on climate change is not that great, Jacinda and in case you didn\u2019t know, we still sell coal to China.\nBut there is nothing like the hypocrisy of the left, is there?\nForeign\u00a0Minister Winston Peters has moved to take the heat out of\u00a0Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern\u2019s challenge to Australia on climate change, and says Pacific nations which seek Chinese investment should remember it comes on the back of \u201ccoal-fired everything\u201d.\nPeters said calls for Australia to step-up on climate change were a \u201cbit of a paradox\u201d because many Pacific countries were not openly challenging China\u2019s reliance on coal.\nAustralia has come under fire from some leaders at the Pacific Islands Forum for what they say is a lack of\u00a0action on climate change\u00a0and tardiness to shift away coal-fired power.\nIt is amazing how easy targets are always hit. Scott Morrison is the first Australian premier to go to the Pacific Islands Forum for 35 years. He will probably be the last for the next 200 years. But nobody ever tackles China, who are the biggest emitters in the world by a country mile because everyone is too afraid to go there.\nThe New Zealand prime minister said on Wednesday\u00a0every nation needed to \u201cdo its bit\u201d in the fight against climate change, and Australia would have to \u201canswer to the Pacific\u201d for its own role.\nJust a thought, but if you want Australia to stop sending our criminals home might you not consider being slightly more diplomatic?\nNo. Of course not.\nSpeaking on ABC radio on Thursday morning, Peters, who is also\u00a0deputy prime minister, said there was \u201ca big picture we have to contemplate\u201d to act with consistency and integrity.\nHe said while island nations were worried about their long-term future amid rising sea levels and more fierce weather events, China\u2019s high emissions also had to be part of the conversation.\n\u201cYou need to look at everybody, not just Australia, but also who is getting that coal and what things they are doing with it,\u201d\u00a0Peters said.\nFinally, someone has said it. Let us stop picking on those countries who will probably keep footing the bill anyway and point out the bleeding obvious. Unless emissions from China and India are reduced dramatically, the world will go to hell in a handcart (if it is actually going to hell in a handcart, but for the purposes of this discussion.. it is) regardless of anything that either New Zealand or Australia manages to do.\n\u201cWhat I\u2019m sadly hearing is variations on a theme \u2026 that they\u2019re all attacking the Australian Prime Minister or that they\u2019ve all taken the view, including New Zealand\u2019s Prime Minister, that the Australians are somehow acting incorrectly when that is not the proper picture or the real picture at all.\u201d\nAustralia has pushed back on attempts from smaller island states to include a strong statement urging the world to speed up its transition away from coal towards renewable energy.\nPeters said leaders meeting in Tuvalu must \u201clook at all the details\u201d and defended Australia\u2019s stance on climate change.\nMost of you know that I am no Winston Peters fan, but he is completely right on this. He is bringing a harsh dose of reality into the game, and he is also trying to pour oil on the rapidly becoming very troubled waters of the Pacific Islands. If they upset the Australians too much, then they just might tell all the other Pacific nations to go\u2026 find themselves. That includes New Zealand, in case you didn\u2019t know.\nHe said the island countries should remember Australia was a \u201cgreat neighbour\u201d to the Pacific.\n\u201cThey should remember who has been their long-term and short-term friends,\u201d he said.", "label": 1}, "dev-82": {"text": "A Major Threat to Our Economy \u2013 Environmental Extremism\nA decade ago, an economic crisis gripped the United States. Washington, D.C. responded by spending other peoples\u2019 money on corporate bailouts and a $787 billion \u201cstimulus.\u201c\n\nThroughout those dark economic times, however, the oil and natural gas sector shined bright \u2013 without help from Washington. It shines even brighter today, to the benefit of all energy consumers.\n\nIn 2009, the U.S. surpassed Russia as the world\u2019s top supplier of natural gas. A few years later, American producers surpassed Saudi Arabia as the largest supplier of all petroleum products. Today, American energy is an even greater economic powerhouse, creating jobs and spurring economic growth across the country.\nDomestic oil supply has more than doubled over the last decade, making the U.S. the world\u2019s top producer of crude. Last year, energy companies operating in America produced more natural gas than the entire Middle East.\n\nIn a few short years, the U.S. will likely become the world\u2019s largest exporter of liquefied natural gas (LNG). Exporting \u201cfreedom molecules,\u201d as the Department of Energy calls them, gives our allies a stable energy source that can help relieve their dangerous dependence on Russian fuel.\n\nAmerica\u2019s energy boom should be celebrated, not demonized. As our energy sector has grown and prospered, so have all the supporting manufacturing and service industries that support it. And U.S. consumers have enjoyed the lower electric bills and pump prices that come with increased supplies.\n\nFurthermore, the shale revolution has quite literally saved lives. Cheaper home heating is averting more than 10,000 winter deaths per year, according to a recent working paper from the National Bureau of Economic Research.\n\nYet all this good news could be brought to a grinding halt \u2013 and then reversed \u2013 if environmental extremists get their way. One example of their radical proposals is the Green New Deal, which calls for the elimination of conventional energy sources. Like so many of these proposals, it aims to use regulations, taxes and outright bans on natural resource development to drive up the price of energy sources they don\u2019t like, and taxpayer dollars and mandates to subsidize the kinds of energy they do like.\n\nIt\u2019s not just a matter of favoring carbon-free energy sources over those that emit carbon. If that were the case, these plans would be all in on hydroelectric and nuclear power. The fact that they\u2019re not demonstrates the hypocrisy \u2013 and the irrationality \u2013 of the whole agenda.\n\nUnder their radical energy policies, Americans would suffer multiple times over. They would pay higher taxes to cover the subsidies. They would pay more on their energy bills. And they would be hit again and again through higher prices for food, clothes and health care as businesses pass their pricier energy costs onto consumers.\n\nAnd despite claims of economic justice, these policies would inevitably hit low-income families the hardest. After all, they spend a higher percentage of their budget on energy costs.\n\nWill the climate benefit be worth the economic squeeze that big government policies like the Green New Deal would inflict upon Americans? Hardly.\n\nA climate model developed by the National Center for Atmospheric Research allows us to assess how different climate policies will affect global temperatures and sea levels. Even if the U.S. were to achieve a net-zero greenhouse gas emissions target, it would abate global warming by approximately 0.2 degrees Celsius by the year 2100. The reduction in sea level rise would be less than 2 centimeters.\n\nOne final observation: The U.S. shouldn\u2019t be the focus of those determined to reduce carbon emissions. As Philip Rossetti, former director for energy policy at the American Action Forum, pointed out in a recent report, 92 percent of carbon dioxide emissions growth will come from countries that are not members of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development.\n\nThe developing world, where nearly 1 billion people do not have access to electricity, places a much higher priority on tackling energy poverty. The International Energy Agency projects that coal, oil and natural gas will likely meet the overwhelming majority of the world\u2019s energy needs well into the future.\n\nPolicies that stomp out America\u2019s energy boom would have the unintended consequence of making the planet worse off. Regulations that limit domestic energy supplies will not stop the domestic or global consumption of natural resources that environmental activists loathe. If policymakers were to prohibit domestic natural resource extraction, the much more realistic outcome is that production will shift to places where the environmental and safety standards are not as rigorous.\n\nEnergy is a key building block for economic prosperity and higher standards of living. Skepticism of policies like the Green New Deal is not a concession that we should care about jobs numbers and the economy over the environment. On the contrary, it is a warning that if Washington goes for a command-and-control energy policy \u2013 a three-legged stool of tax, regulate and keep-it-in-the-ground \u2013 America will lose on both.", "label": 1}, "dev-83": {"text": "Stoned 'Tarzan' arrested at zoo\nPublished: Wednesday, August 5, 2015, 4:36 PM Updated: Wednesday, August 5, 2015, 4:36 PM A half naked man who covered himself in mud and tried to swing his way into the monkey exhibit at the Santa Ana, Calif., zoo was likely under the influence of drugs, policetold TV Station KTLA.

Much of the material (see Myth 27) illustrates a complete ignorance about climate change and simple atmospheric physics.\n1. \u201cClimate has changed before\u201d:\u00a0Climate reacts to whatever forces it to change at the time :humans are now the dominant factor.\nHumans are not the dominant factor, they have a very minor effect. If all the Paris 2015 commitments are kept through to 2100 the maximum effect on temperature could be 0.17 degrees C. See Myth 24.\n2. \u201cIt is not bad\u201d:\u00a0Negative effects of global warming on agriculture, health & environment far outweigh any positives.\nThis is nonsense. A comprehensive report prepared for MAF in 2008, indicated little effect on NZ\u2019s agricultural production through to 2100. Further effects on health are overstated, and a warm planet is a lot healthier place to be than a cooling planet.\n3. \u201cThere is no consensus\u201d:\u00a097% of scientists agree humans are causing global warming.\nAgain the warmist claims are not based on sound science, the so called consensus is simply warmist propaganda see\u00a0\u201cWhy Scientists Disagree About Global Warming\u201c.\u00a0There is no such thing as \u201cconsensus\u201d in science and the so called consensus(s) don\u2019t exist.\n4. \u201cIts Cooling\u201d:\u00a0On average 2000 to 2009 was the hottest decade on record.\nClimate records exist only from abut 1860, a mere speck of geological time. It is clear from many scientific references that the Medieval Warm Period (900 to 1300 AD) and the Roman Warm Period (2000 years ago) were both warmer \u2026 see figure\nThere is nothing unusual in the present weather and climate patterns from evidence over the past several thousand years.\n5. \u201cAnimals and plants can adapt\u201d:\u00a0Global warming will cause mass extinctions of species that cannot adapt on short term time scales.\nAlarmist assumptions, there is no guarantee that the planet will continue to warm, in fact, there is every indication that some cooling might be on the way.\n6. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t warmed since 1998\u201d:\u00a0Every part of the earth\u2019s climate system has continued warming since 1998, with 2015 shattering temperature records.\nThis is a standard response using land-based data. There are many variations of such a graph \u2026\nThere is a significant effect of the errors due to poorly sited climate measurement stations in the land-based climate records, i.e. the UHI effect (Urban Heat Island), and this is well illustrated in the difference between the land based record and the new Climate Reference Network (CRN) set up about 2004 by NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) in the US set up the CRN network where 120 new stations without any possible outside interference with the climate measurements were established throughout the USA. Early results are below (from\u00a0The USCRN Revisited)\u2026\nThis doesn\u2019t look like continued warming since 1998, in fact, it seems to show natural variation with little warming. Not unsurprisingly NOAA in the USA continue to use the previous land-based records, as they fit the narrative of continued warming.\nIn addition, the\u00a0lower atmospheric record (Trophosphere)\u00a0also doesn\u2019t show continued upward movement in temperature thus the educational resource response information is incorrect.\nFurther, the climate models on which warming predictions are made\u00a0overestimate\u00a0warming by a factor of about 3 times.\n7. \u201cIts cold\u201d:\u00a0A local cold day has nothing to do with the long-term trend of increasing global temperatures.\nThe suggestion that \u201cits cold\u201d is a climate myth is just silly.\n8. \u201cExtreme weather isn\u2019t caused by global warming\u201d:\u00a0Extreme weather events are being made more frequent and worse by climate change.\nAgain this is not the case, as exemplified in several reviews see\u00a0review by New Zealand\u2019s Professor (Engineering) Mike Kelly\u00a0from Cambridge in the UK.\nAs the narrative has changed from global warming, to climate change, now it has progressed to climate disruption / extreme weather, and we get virtually every weather event attributed to climate change. This is simply not the case. There is no strong scientific evidence that climate change caused by humans has effects on extreme weather as frequently claimed by Government scientists.\n9. \u201cClimate Scientists are in it for the Money\u201d:\u00a0Climate scientists could make more money in other careers, most notably working for the oil industry.\nAgain this comment is simply silly. Most climate scientists would be unsuitably qualified for employment in the oil industry. The so-called myth above comes from the situation where \u2026\n10. \u201cHuman CO2 is a tiny % of CO2 emissions\u201d: The natural cycle adds and removes CO2 to keep a balance, humans add extra CO2 without removing any.\nSo what! one might say? The amount of CO2 from human activities is only 3-4% of all the CO2 which goes into the atmosphere each year, and the human influences on the climate are a small (1%) perturbation to natural energy flows. How this minor influence can be construed to be the driver of climate is mystifying indeed.\n11. \u201cPolar Bear Numbers are Increasing\u201d:\u00a0Polar Bears are in danger of extinction as well as many other species.\nAgain this is just silly, Polar Bear Numbers are higher than they have ever been since population number estimates have been attempted. The facts are that in the 1950s the numbers were down to about 5,000, and have been increasing since then, to a figure of 30,000 or more, no danger of extinction. See\u00a010 Good Reasons Not to Worry About Polar Bears, from Dr Susan Crockford, evolutionary biologist and expert on polar bear evolution.\n12. \u201cCO2 limits will harm the Economy\u201d:\u00a0The benefits of a price on carbon outweigh the costs several times over.\nAgain we have a glib definitive statement completely without justification. What would the primary school kids understand about \u201ca cost on carbon\u201d, very little I suggest. The statement in the document I assume is meant to say that imposed costs to achieve reductions in CO2 (not carbon) emissions will be small in comparison to the costs of damages re climate change if we don\u2019t reduce emissions.\nThere are no reliable data concerning such a contention, we, in fact, have no idea whether there will be continued warming, and whether this will have real costs at all? All the contentions are based on \u201ccomputer models\u201d which thus far are predicting much higher warming than has been recorded over the past few decades. See Myth 6.\n13. \u201cIt\u2019s a Natural Cycle\u201d:\u00a0No known natural forcing fits the fingerprints of observed warming except anthropogenic greenhouse gases.\nThis says \u201cin our computer models, we can\u2019t think of anything else that is causing warming, so it must be CO2\u201d. This is completely unscientific? There is no fitting with any fingerprint of observed warming.\n14. \u201cScientists can\u2019t even predict the weather\u201d:\u00a0Weather and climate are different, climate predictions do not need weather detail.\nNot sure where this myth came from? When the climate models are \u201crunning hot\u201d (see Myth 6, then where dos the confidence about the predictions of future warming come from? How is it that the scientists are confident that the climate will simply keep on warming? There is no consideration in any of the scenarios of any cooling, which is quite possible in the future?\n15. \u201cCO2 limits will hurt the poor\u201d:\u00a0Those who contribute the least greenhouse gases will be most impacted by climate change.\nNot sure where this contention comes from? Those who contribute the lowest levels of Greenhouse Gas emissions are certainly the least developed countries, many of which are being denied cheap energy (coal) to allow them to develop and improve their standard of living.\nA good question for the school children could be \u201cdo you have the moral right to suggest that undeveloped countries be restricted in their development by reducing their own emissions\u201d. Clearly the answer to this is no.\nIn fact under the Paris Agreement 2015, Developing Countries have the right to keep improving their standard of living until 2030 at least.\nAlso CO2 limits and massive reductions touted as required to reduce warming will be politically unacceptable, and practically impossible. Consider \u2026\u2026\n16. \u201cVolcanos emit more CO2 than humans\u201d:\u00a0Humans emit 100 times more CO2 than volcanos.\nNot sure how this is calculated, and whether undersea volcanos are included. Certainly the Pinatubo eruption in 1991 caused some earth cooling over the subsequent 2 or 3 years, 0.4 to 0.7 degrees C. Clearly volcanoes are unpredictable, not under human influence, but potentially of massive capability.\n17. \u201cRecord snowfall disproves global warming\u201d:\u00a0Warming leads to increased evaporation and precipitation, which falls as increased snow in the winter.\nAny record temperatures, precipitation via rain or snowfall at individual places on the globe, do not prove anything about the world\u2019s climate.\n18. CO2 limits will make little difference\u201d \u2013 (presumably to climate?):\u00a0If every nation agrees to limit CO2 emissions, we can achieve significant cuts on a global scale.\nCan\u2019t argue with this,\u00a0BUT\u00a0whether this will have any effect on climate is another matter. It is clear that water vapour is the main Greenhouse Gas, and that methane and nitrous oxide are of trivial importance, and CO2 not much above them\u00a0 (see Allison and Sheahan,\u00a0Greenhouse Gases: a More Realistic View\u00a0(pdf), or a popular version from a farming newspaper,\u00a0\u201cWater blamed as big planet warmer\u201d).\nThus cutting emissions will have a negligible effect on the temperature. Humans are naive enough to think they can control the climate through manipulation of CO2 \u2013 they can\u2019t control the climate and CO2 is not the main driver anyway. Huge negative impacts on the agricultural economy are not justified for no predictable outcome.\n19. \u201cRenewable energy is too expensive:\u00a0When you account for all the costs associated with burning coal and other fossil fuels, like air pollution and health effects, they are significantly more expensive than most renewable energy sources.\nNot sure what this is about? If renewables wind and solar were so economically attractive then why after the technologies being available for the last 20 to 30 years, do they not have a greater share of world energy. Presently world energy use is still about 85% fossil fuels and renewables are very minor contributors \u2026.\n(From\u00a0\u201cThe Energy emergency and the Space Option\u201d)\nSome reality is required as to what is possible re alternative fuels and the disadvantages of the high levels of renewables being integrated into national grids. Blackouts in South Australia is a good example of the unreliability of significant levels of wind and solar.\nCertainly discussion of alternative energy supplies is a relevant education topic, but that discussion should be based on reality, not green ideologies. A rapid shift away from fossil fuels is simply not practically or economically possible.\u00a0Clearly the response here (blue typing above) is unrealistic.\n20. \u201cHumans are too insignificant to affect global climate\u201d:\u00a0Humans are small but powerful, and human CO2 emissions are causing global warming.\nThis is a very glib and inaccurate comment. Humans are pretty insignificant on the world scale. For examples in terms of total biomass volume, humans make up about half a cubic km \u2013 this in comparison with the 30 million cubic km of ice on earth.\u00a0 The education comment above is based on the assumption that human CO2 drives climate change. There is no good scientific evidence for that. I.e. the climate models are nowhere near predicting the climate.\n21. \u201cIt\u2019s too hard\u201d:\u00a0Scientific studies have determined that current technology is enough to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to avoid dangerous climate change.\nAgain this is nonsense. It simply isn\u2019t possible!! If there was the resolve to reduce emissions while we had the world agreement (we have had the world governments agreeing that emissions should be reduced since 1992, and yet since that time the total world emissions have increased by more than 60%. Simply there is no practical resolve or commitment to make the massive reductions possible.\nThere is not the technology available as contended above, no technology available for Carbon Recapture & Storage which has no example of working on a large sale anywhere, no technology available for the reduction of methane etc.\nA good education discussion in schools would be the massive protests in Chile, France, Holland and Germany when Governments have tried to impose emissions reductions policies, for example\u00a0here\u00a0and\u00a0here.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Politics is the art of the possible, already government policies are having to be modified on the basis of protests.\n22. \u201cIt\u2019s not urgent\u201d:\u00a0A large amount of warming is delayed, and if we don\u2019t act now, we could pass tipping points.\nWhat tipping points? There is no good scientific information which suggests that such tipping points exist. There have been many doomsday predictions made in the past few decades.\u00a0\u00a0Al Gore has made many predictions re temperature rise and disappearing Arctic Ice, which haven\u2019t happened, similarly Prince Charles has made many such predictions along with many other politicians and scientists. For a catalogue of failed predictions, see\u00a0\u201c50 Years of Failed Doomsday Eco-Pocalyptic Predictions: the So-Called Experts Are 0-50\u201d\u00a0.\nEven the UN say that climate policy is not about climate \u2026\u201d We redistribute de facto the world\u2019s wealth by climate policy\u201d \u2026 \u201cOne has to free oneself from the illusion that international climate policy, is environmental policy, it has almost nothing to do with environmental policy anymore\u201d Dr Otttmar Endenhofer, IPCC Co Chair Working Group III, 2010.\n23. \u201cClimate is chaotic and can not be predicted\u201d:\u00a0Weather is chaotic but climate is driven by Earth\u2019s energy imbalance, which is more predictable.\nThis is too complicated for discussion in schools, Climate is certainly chaotic and relatively unpredictable. This is why it can\u2019t be modelled effectively.\n24. \u201cAdapting to global warming is cheaper than preventing it\u201d:\u00a0Preventing global warming is relatively cheap, while a \u201cbusiness as usual \u201c approach will cause accelerating climate change.\nThis is Green Policy hype with no scientific backing. We do not even know whether the earth is going to continue to warm (it is assumed so, without scientific evidence \u2013 computer models are not evidence). The amounts of money estimates to have any effect on climate are in trillions, with predicted very minor effects on climate. See\u00a0\u201cParis climate promises will reduce temperatures by just 0.05\u00b0C in 2100?\u00a0(peer-reviewed study).\nFurther adaptation allows action to be taken if, and when effects happen, eminently sensible when specifics of the future climate are unclear. Nothing will happen very fast so this is the strategy that should be adopted.\n25. Renewable energy investment kills jobs\u201d:\u00a0Investment in renewable energy creates more jobs than investment in the fossil fuel industry.\nThere has been a lot written about renewable energy creating more \u201cgreen jobs\u201d \u2013\u00a0\u00a0Green Jobs\u00a0provides a good analysis. It is very clear that the science does not say that renewable energy investment creates more jobs. Green jobs in many countries have cost about 2 other real jobs per single green job.\n26. \u201cIt\u2019s only a few degrees\u201d:\u00a0A few degrees of global warming have a huge effect on ice sheets, sea levels and other aspects of climate.\nFirstly I have never heard the so called climate myth above. However, it isn\u2019t clear there will be a continuing increase in temperature as predicted by the climate models, to the level of the target 1.5 or 2 degrees C temperature rise since the start of the industrial revolution. Certainly increasing temperature would have an effect on the ice sheets, sea level and other aspects of climate, but there is no certainty that these increases in temperature will materialise.\n27. \u201cRemoving all of the CO2 would make little difference\u201d:\u00a0Removing CO2 from the air would cause most water in the air to rain out and cancel most of the greenhouse effect.\nThis comment just illustrates the complete ignorance about the climate and atmosphere that exists in those preparing this science material for schools. CO2 is plant food and through sunlight, water and CO2, plants create sugars\nTo suggest that removal of most of the CO2 (from the atmosphere) would cause most of the water in the air to rain out and cancel most of the Greenhouse Effect. This implies that most of the so called Greenhouse Effect isn\u2019t required There are several significant problems with this hypothesis\u2026\u2026..\n28 \u201cHeatwaves have happened before\u201d:\u00a0Global warming is increasing the frequency, duration and intensity of heatwaves.\nThe statement \u201cheatwaves have happened before\u201d is not a climate myth, and as noted previously a warm climate is a lot healthier place to be than a cooling climate. Scientific information shows mortality risk attributable to cold is about 17 times higher than heat. See this from\u00a0The Lancet,\u00a0seen as the bible of medical technology publication. The much discussed consequences for human health from a warming climate illustrate in my opinion, simply the medical profession and academia tapping into the substantial financial resources available for climate related topics.\nShare this:\nIf you enjoyed this BFD article please consider sharing it with your friends.", "label": 1}, "dev-85": {"text": "Our House Is on Fire by Greta Thunberg et al review \u2013 a family and planet in crisis\nA movement born without a face tends to acquire one. Since August 2018, when 15-year-old Greta Thunberg began a solo \u201cschool strike for the climate\u201d, the teenager has become the unlikely face of climate activism. Our House Is On Fire is, among many other things, the story of how and why Greta came to be sitting on the pavement outside the Swedish parliament with a home-made placard. The book is co-authored by Greta, her mother Malena Ernman (the primary narrator), her father Svante and her sister Beata. It is an urgent, lucid, courageous account.\n\u201cThe personal is political\u201d was a rallying cry for 1960s demonstrators, and the slogan applies neatly here. The first quarter of Our House Is On Fire describes events in 2011, when Greta sank into depression and the family\u2019s expectations went \u201coff-script\u201d \u2013 for good. She \u201cwas slowly disappearing into some kind of darkness and little by little, bit by bit, she seemed to stop functioning. She stopped playing the piano. She stopped laughing. She stopped talking \u2026 She stopped eating.\u201d\nThe book wastes no time in dispelling any notion that Sweden is a utopia of public services. The description of getting help and a diagnosis out of the adolescent psychiatric services \u2013 \u201cWhere everyone is burned out from struggling with a constantly growing workload and where much of the time is spent putting out fires\u201d \u2013 will have parents across the world groaning with grim recognition. Not a lot better is mainstream education, \u201cwhere all pupils must function in exactly the same way and where overworked teachers on a conveyor belt end up hitting the wall\u201d. Greta was bullied, her school was indifferent, she lost 10kg in two months and reached the brink of hospitalisation before she was, eventually, diagnosed with obsessive compulsive disorder, selective mutism and Asperger syndrome. Her sister, in time, was diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. To live with these conditions is very tough: to care for children living with them and to keep your marriage afloat is also very tough, and behind the book\u2019s matter-of-fact prose, Greta\u2019s parents emerge as involuntary superheroes and recipients of no awards but hard-won wisdom: \u201cPerhaps we will never be fine, but we can always get a little bit better, and there is strength in that. There is hope in that.\u201d\nThe middle quarters of the book stay in touch with the up-and-down progress of Greta\u2019s family, but focus on the climate crisis and its effects on politics, feminism, economics, ecology, psychology and sociology. Don\u2019t be put off by these \u201c\u2013ologies\u201d: the book is a highly readable sequence of shortish \u201cscenes\u201d written in the direct language Greta uses in her speeches. The life-vest of humour inflates more often than you\u2019d expect, and the text is studded with subversive, persuasive maxims: \u201cCarbon offsetting is like paying poor people to diet for us\u201d; \u201cThe truth is just another of those things that can be bought with money\u201d; \u201cWhen you\u2019re used to privilege, equality feels like oppression\u201d. I wrote down several pages of quotations for this review until it got ridiculous: I was copying out half the book.\nWhile many readers will be familiar with much of the science and the contradictions of \u201call you can eat\u201d consumerism, the book also explores the less obvious circuitry that connects apparently disparate things. One impactful passage links our \u201cwinners take all\u201d culture with the explosion of mental illness suffered by the \u201closers\u201d (as defined by the winners) who are disproportionately female, neuro-diverse and/or socially maladroit \u2013 people not unlike Greta Thunberg. Autistic people, as Greta noted in her 2018 Ted Talk, tend not to be good liars, either to others or to themselves. Greta\u2019s initial depression was triggered by her lack of the neurotypical talent to compartmentalise fact A \u201cWe know we are destroying our planet with orgiastic overconsumption\u201d (my words) safely away from fact B \u201cWe carry on regardless.\u201d This talent lets us neurotypicals function as inconvenient truths pile up but it also prevents us from making the systemic changes needed to avert ecological collapse. Famously, Greta has described her Asperger\u2019s as a \u201csuperpower\u201d and the point is well-made. Single-mindedness and immunity to flattery and abuse are crucial qualities for activism. (Writing as the dad of an autistic young man, I view Greta Thunberg as a default autism advocate as well as a climate activist.) In some quarters, however, this way of thinking is a red flag to a bull. \u201cGreta provokes,\u201d observes her mother. \u201cIn certain cases to such an extent that normally respectful people lose their composure. Not only does she say that everything has to change, she has autism too. And she has the gall to brag about it. That\u2019s not how things are supposed to work.\u201d\nGreta\u2019s parents emerge as involuntary super\u00adheroes and recipients of no awards but hard\u2011won wis\u00addom\nTo engage with the climate crisis is to engage with climate crisis denial. A revolution in how we live is needed, and no revolution can succeed without broad support: otherwise, it\u2019s a doomed putsch. Our House Is on Fire makes this engagement with acuity drawn from a deep well of hard-won experience. \u201cOur future ecological state has been reduced to a political game where it\u2019s word against word, and the most popular wins. And guess which climate and sustainability story sells the best? The one that demands changes or the one that says we can continue shopping and flying for all eternity?\u201d\nPiety \u2013 these days rebranded as virtue signalling \u2013 is notable in the book by its absence: \u201cThey say that climate change deniers are idiots. But everyone is a climate change denier. Every single one of us.\u201d The trolls of Greta Thunberg (whose prestigious ranks include Presidents Trump, Bolsonaro and Putin) are considered with an emotional intelligence that is rarely, if ever, reciprocated. The message that business as usual is the enemy is not a welcome one for those of us conducting business as usual. Far comfier to dismiss the messenger as a mentally ill brat, or the stooge of eco-fascist lizard people hellbent on establishing their own World State, than to admit culpability in ecocide. Far easier to dismiss the science as biased, as false, as \u201cnot settled\u201d. The problem is that with every swath of Australia or California burned, every never-before flooded city flooded, every hurricane of record-breaking destruction, and every Florida\u2011sized ice-shelf splitting off from Antarctica, the same message gets affirmed: that business as usual will roast us, drown us or starve us.\nThe final quarter of the book describes the tension-filled days leading up to Greta\u2019s Skolstrejk f\u00f6r klimatet outside the Swedish parliament. There are reasons some things go viral and some things don\u2019t. There is an ancient power in symbol and narrative. There is a powerful magnetism in the defiance of the powerless. These are glimpsed in a scene during a meeting with climatologists and family friends in Uppsala: \u201cThere is a pause. These thoughts take over the room \u2013 that the almost invisible little girl on the chair by the window is planning to put herself at the very centre of the spotlight, and, all alone, in her own thoughts and words, question the foundation of the prevailing world order.\u201d Greta\u2019s parents\u2019 anxieties about exposing their 15-year-old daughter to incoming flak from any ill-disposed passerby in Stockholm are matched by Greta\u2019s resolve to stage her strike no matter what, and by a growing sense that activism is a strange kind of cure. What happened next on that pavement in Stockholm is well-documented elsewhere \u2013 but everyone with an interest in the future of the planet should read this book. It is a clear-headed diagnosis. It is a glimpse of a saner world. It is fertile with hope.\n\u2022 David Mitchell\u2019s novels include Cloud Atlas.

Last month, Andrew Brown shared heartbreaking pictures of his daughter Hayley when she was left with just one eyelash after chemotherapy. But now the little girl has been told that the cancerous tumour in her nose has gone. Hayley Brown, seven, was told the good news just four days before Christmas and her dad Andrew Brown has said he was \u201cfeeling relieved\u201d after six months of cancer treatment. The family, from Melbourne, were thrown into turmoil in June when doctors discovered a 5cm tumour growing inside Hayley\u2019s nose and diagnosed her with cancer. Hayley was told she would need eight months of chemotherapy and radiotherapy to fight the disease, but now just six months later they have shared the happy news. Andrew, a Melbourne based comedian, took to Facebook to share a picture of two X-rays side-by-side- one from June and the latest one taken this week. The scans were taken at the Royal Children\u2019s Hospital in Melbourne. The dad-of-four said: \u201cThe red X on the June picture is on a big grey area. That is the tumour. \u201cThe red X on today\u2019s scan is on black which is how an empty nasal cavity is supposed to look.\u201d The dad added a sweet message to his brave daughter to his post, saying: \u201cWell done Hayley you little Warrior Princess, you rock.

The CO2 equivalent system has no scientific integrity and most of the theoretical carbon emissions it generates from methane emissions do not represent the emission of any real greenhouse gas which causes any increase in the atmospheric concentration of any real greenhouse gas.\n\u2018The Government insists that this curriculum is science-based so science needs to step up and ensure that it is. A resource stating agriculture produces 48.1 % of our greenhouse gas emissions is in effect lying to our children which should not happen in a supposedly science-based programme.\n\u2018Children are also being told they can reduce their carbon footprint by eating less meat and dairy. This is also not science because the carbon footprint calculator this statement relies on uses the discredited and political (rather than scientific) CO2 equivalent system, which overstates the impact agriculture has on the greenhouse effect caused by greenhouse gases.\n\u2018Science is also very clear that reducing methane emissions, which is the main greenhouse gas produced by agriculture, will make no difference to peak global temperature and importantly reducing meat and dairy consumption must not be done at the expense of CO2 emissions. This means students must be told that it is not an option to choose to reduce meat and dairy consumption instead of reducing CO2 emissions. A dietary warning for people with developing bodies would be a prudent addition as well if teachers want to avoid lawsuits.\n\u2018The truth about the discredited CO2 equivalent system would also make a welcome addition to the curriculum and scientists should insist on that.\n\u2018Mental health issues should also be included in the topic with students taught that pointing out the flaws in a deeply flawed political system of quantifying greenhouse gases is not climate change denial as alarmists claim, and in fact, that term is tantamount to bullying by people who just fear questions they don\u2019t like.", "label": 1}, "dev-89": {"text": "Al Gore Can\u2019t Deny That His Climate Crusade Involves Great Suffering\nThe more than seven billion people living in the world today need affordable, abundant energy \u2014 and a\u00a0livable climate \u2014 to flourish. But the world\u2019s leading source of energy is also the leading source of increasing greenhouse gases.\nWhat to do? This is the vital question Al Gore took on in his 2006 film An Inconvenient Truth, and takes on again in his newly released follow\u2010\u200bup An Inconvenient Sequel.\nAs the most influential figure in the international climate conversation, Gore has a\u00a0responsibility to give us the\u00a0whole picture\u00a0of fossil fuels\u2019 impacts \u2014 both their benefits and the risks they pose to humans flourishing. Unfortunately, Gore has given us a\u00a0deeply biased picture that completely ignores fossil fuels\u2019 indispensable benefits and wildly exaggerates their impact on climate.\n\nThe running theme throughout An Inconvenient Sequel is that Gore\u2019s first film was even more right than he expected. The movie begins with defenders of fossil fuels mocking or ignoring the dramatic predictions of An Inconvenient Truth. Leaving aside a\u00a0heroic (and highly disputed) portrayal of Gore rescuing the Paris climate accord, the rest of the movie focuses on vindicating Gore\u2019s two chief predictions: 1) That we could replace fossil fuels with cheap solar\u2010 and wind\u2010\u200bpowered \u201crenewables\u201d; and 2) that continued use of fossil fuels would lead to catastrophic temperature rises, catastrophic sea\u2010\u200blevel rises, catastrophic flooding, catastrophic drought, catastrophic storms, and catastrophic disease proliferation.\nTo justify these claims, Gore makes extensive uses of anecdotes: he shows us the town of Georgetown, Tex. and its use of \u00a0100\u2010\u200bper\u2010\u200bcent renewable energy, a\u00a0deadly heat wave in India, a\u00a0deadly flood in Miami, a\u00a0deadly drought in Syria, a\u00a0deadly storm in the Philippines, and the Zika virus penetrating the United States.\nSome of his anecdotes are meant to prove that cheap solar and wind are, as 2006 Gore prophesied, quickly dominating the world\u2019s energy supply and, as 2006 Gore also warned us, that our rapidly warming climate is killing more and more people each year. But he has not given us the whole picture.\nTake the rising dominance of solar and wind, which is used to paint supporters of fossil fuels as troglodytes, fools, and shills for Big Oil. The combined share of world energy consumption from renewables\u00a0is all of\u00a0two per cent.\u00a0And it\u2019s an expensive, unreliable, and therefore difficult\u2010\u200bto\u2010\u200bscale two per cent.\nBecause solar and wind are \u201cunreliables,\u201d they need to be backed up by reliable sources of power, usually fossil fuels, or sometimes non\u2010\u200bcarbon sources including nuclear and large\u2010\u200bscale hydro power (all of which\u00a0Gore\u00a0and\u00a0other environmentalists\u00a0refuse to support). This is why every grid that incorporates significant solar and wind has more expensive electricity. Germans, on the hook for Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s self\u2010\u200brighteous anti\u2010\u200bcarbon commitments, are already\u00a0paying three times the rates for electricity that Americans do.\nStories about \u201c100\u2010\u200bper\u2010\u200bcent renewable\u201d locations like Georgetown, Tex. are not just anecdotal evidence, they are lies. The\u00a0Texas grid\u00a0from which Georgetown draws its electricity is comprised of 43.7 per cent natural gas, 28.8 per cent coal, 12 per cent nuclear, and only 15.6 per cent renewable. Using a\u00a0virtue\u2010\u200bsignalling gimmick pioneered by\u00a0Apple, Facebook, and Google, Georgetown pays its state utility to label its grid electricity \u201crenewable\u201d \u2014\u00a0even though it draws its power from that fossil\u2010\u200bfuel heavy Texas grid \u2014 while tarring others on the grid as \u201cnon\u2010\u200brenewable.\u201d\nIf we look at the overall trends instead of engaging in anecdotal manipulation we see that fossil fuel energy is the\u00a0fastest\u2010\u200bgrowing energy source\u00a0in the world \u2014 still. Fossil fuels have never been more vital to human flourishing. There are\u00a01,600 coal\u00a0Advances in technology are making fossil fuels cleaner, safer, and more efficient than ever. To reduce their growth let alone to radically restrict their use \u2014 which is what Gore advocates \u2014\u00a0means forcing\u00a0energy poverty\u00a0on billions of people.\nGore and others should be free to make the case that the danger of greenhouse gases is so serious as to warrant that scale of human misery. But they should have to quantify and justify the magnitude of climate danger. And that brings us to the truth about climate.\nThe overall trend in climate danger is that it is at an all\u2010\u200btime low. The\u00a0Emergency Events Database\u00a0(EM-DAT) shows 6,114 climate\u2010\u200brelated deaths in 2016. In other recent years the numbers have maxed out in the tens of thousands. Compare this to the 1930s when, adjusted for population, climate\u2010\u200brelated deaths hit the 10\u2010\u200bmillion mark several times.\nThe most significant cause of our radically reduced climate danger is industrial development, which takes a\u00a0naturally dangerous climate and makes it unnaturally safe. And industrial development is driven by cheap, plentiful, reliable energy \u2014 which, today, overwhelmingly means\u00a0fossil fuels. Climate will always be dangerous so priority number one is to have the energy and development to tame it. Modern irrigation, residential heating and air conditioning have made once uninhabitable places perfectly comfortable.\nGore\u2019s\u00a0Inconvenient Sequel\u00a0gives a\u00a0biased, self\u2010\u200bserving, and convenient picture of fossil fuels and climate \u2014 convenient for Gore\u2019s legacy, that is, but inconvenient for the billions his energy poverty policies will harm.

There is no greater threat than climate disruption\nThe first duty of a government is to protect the people. There is no greater threat than climate disruption as the world heads to 3C or more warming, possibly by mid-century, yet the prime minister is unwilling to explain the implications.\nAsked by Zali Steggall in parliament recently about the costs of 3C of warming, Scott Morrison replied that \u201cwe do understand there are costs associated with climate change\u201d, but was incapable of saying what they were.\nAs a diversionary tactic in our climate debate, it invariably works, focusing attention on the supposedly horrendous costs of action, for example building the new zero-carbon energy system; a discussion which skates over the fact that replacing ageing coal-fired generators with renewable energy will be cheaper than rebuilding with coal or gas, as the solar/wind/battery option slips under the fossil-fuel-energy cost curve.\nCommentators repeatedly frame debate around the recent 2050 net zero emissions policy adopted by the ALP, and now supported by many others, in terms of its \u201ccosts\u201d, without mentioning the benefits: huge damages avoided by reducing the level of global warming by concerted global action.\nIn fact those damages, at only 3C, may be beyond quantification. Work from the University of Melbourne in 2019 has shown that on current global emissions patterns, a conservative estimate of costs for Australia would be $584.5bn by 2030, $762bn by 2050, and more than $5tn in cumulative damages from now until 2100. On the other hand, the cost of effective emissions reduction is estimated to be $35.5bn up to 2030, or 0.14% of cumulative GDP, a negligible impact.\nSuch estimates focus on infrastructure damage, agricultural and labour productivity losses, human health impacts and ecosystem losses, but this is the tip of the iceberg. The costs of extreme weather events are not included, and more importantly, neither are the economic damages that Australia will incur as 3C of warming sweeps through Asia and the Pacific, devastating nations, disrupting major trading partners and supply chains, and likely turning the region \u2013 the \u201cdisaster alley\u201d of global climate disruption \u2013 into one of social chaos and breakdown.\nThirteen years ago, senior US national security analysts looked at the consequences of 3C of warming and concluded that it would \u201cgive rise to massive nonlinear societal events. In this scenario, nations around the world will be overwhelmed by the scale of change and pernicious challenges \u2026 Armed conflict between nations over resources \u2026 is likely and nuclear war is possible. The social consequences range from increased religious fervour to outright chaos\u201d.\nAustralia\u2019s intelligence community, and the prime minister\u2019s office, are well aware of this analysis, and have a duty of care to brief Morrison on its risk assessment. So when he refuses to admit the impacts of a 3C world, ignorance is not an excuse.\nAustralian government climate denial has played a leading role in ensuring that a 3\u20134C future has become accepted in global policy making circles as \u201cpolitically realistic\u201d. The increasing concern from climate researchers that such a world is likely to be climatically unstable and incompatible with the survival of human civilisation as we know it is totally ignored.\nA survey of the scientific literature on the likely impacts of 3C paints a frightening picture. We described such an outcome in a recent report, The Third Degree, on the implications for Australia of existential climate-related security risks. In such a world, it is likely that the structures of societies will be severely tested, and some will crash. The poorest nations will suffer first and most deeply from climate change, but, after three decades of inaction, no nation will now escape.\nWater availability will decrease sharply in the lower latitude dry tropics and subtropics, and affect almost two billion people worldwide. Agriculture will become nonviable in the dry subtropics. The Sahara will jump the Mediterranean, as Europeans begin a long trek north. Water flows into the great rivers of Asia will be reduced by the loss of more than one half, and perhaps much more, of the Himalayan ice sheet.\nAridification will emerge over more than 30% of the world\u2019s land surface, most severely in southern Africa, the southern Mediterranean, west Asia, the Middle East, rural Australia and across the south-western US.\nMost regions in the world will experience a significant drop in food production and increasing numbers of extreme weather events, including heat waves, floods and storms. Food production will be inadequate to feed the global population and food prices will skyrocket, as a consequence of a one fifth decline in crop yields, a decline in the nutritional content of food crops, a catastrophic decline in insect populations, aridification, monsoon failure and chronic water shortages, and conditions too hot for human summer habitation in significant food-growing regions.\nThe lower reaches of the agriculturally important river deltas such as the Mekong, Ganges and Nile will be inundated, and significant sectors of some of the world\u2019s most populous cities \u2013 including Kolkata, Mumbai, Jakarta, Guangzhou, Tianjin, Hong Kong, Ho Chi Minh City, Shanghai, Lagos, Bangkok and Miami \u2013 abandoned.\nDeadly heat conditions will persist for more than 100 days per year in West Africa, Central America, the Middle East, South-East Asia and parts of Australia, which together with land degradation, aridification, conflicts over land and water, and rising sea levels will contribute to up to a billion people being displaced.

It is hoped that the predicted cooling due to lowered sunspot activity during Solar Cycle 25 may assist.\nThe 0.5\u00b0C temperature increase since pre-industrial times has meant that the results released by the Iowa Democratic Party were riddled with inconsistencies and other flaws. Apparently the temperature increase is causing widespread chaos as more than 100 precincts reported results that were internally inconsistent, were missing data or were not possible under the complex rules of the Iowa caucuses.\nIn some cases, vote tallies do not add up, just like a lot of global warming, climate change claims. In others, precincts are shown allotting the wrong number of delegates to certain candidates. This is another climate change effect: wrong numbers are regularly assigned to historical temperature recordings.

Arochi's defense attorney Keith Gore had objected during closing arguments to the state's sole focus on his client. \"There's no evidence of what, when, where or how,\" he said in attempting to dismiss the case against Arochi, which he said was circumstantial.

Three minutes later, Arochi's 2010 Chevrolet Camaro pulled out of the garage, they said. An hour after that, cell tower data indicated that Arochi's and Morris' phones still were together. Prosecutors also told jurors that Morris' DNA was found on the mat in the trunk of Arochi's car. Police found Morris' vehicle in the parking garage three days later, after she was reported missing. Arochi's defense challenged the DNA finding, and presented an expert who testified that the cell tower data could be unreliable. Defense attorney Gore also suggested police overlooked the possible alleged involvement in Morris' disappearance of her boyfriend, Hunter Foster, who is currently serving a 33-month federal prison sentence for conspiracy to distribute MDMA.

Governments are not assembling emergency national plans and you\u2019re not getting push notifications transmitted to your phone breathlessly alerting you to dramatic twists and developments from South Korea to Italy.\nMore than 3,000 people have succumbed to coronavirus yet, according to the World Health Organization, air pollution alone \u2013 just one aspect of our central planetary crisis \u2013 kills seven million people every year. There have been no Cobra meetings for the climate crisis, no sombre prime ministerial statements detailing the emergency action being taken to reassure the public. In time, we\u2019ll overcome any coronavirus pandemic. With the climate crisis, we are already out of time, and are now left mitigating the inevitably disastrous consequences hurtling towards us.\nWhile coronavirus is understandably treated as an imminent danger, the climate crisis is still presented as an abstraction whose consequences are decades away. Unlike an illness, it is harder to visualise how climate breakdown will affect us each as individuals. Perhaps when unprecedented wildfires engulfed parts of the Arctic last summer there could have been an urgent conversation about how the climate crisis was fuelling extreme weather, yet there wasn\u2019t. In 2018, more than 60 million people suffered the consequences of extreme weather and climate change, including more than 1,600 who perished in Europe, Japan and the US because of heatwaves and wildfires. Mozambique, Malawi and Zimbabwe were devastated by cyclone Idai, while hurricanes Florence and Michael inflicted $24bn (\u00a318.7bn) worth of damage on the US economy, according to the World Meteorological Organization.\nAs the recent Yorkshire floods illustrate, extreme weather \u2013 with its terrible human and economic costs \u2013 is ever more a fact of British life. Antarctic ice is melting more than six times faster than it was four decades ago and Greenland\u2019s ice sheet four times faster than previously thought. According to the UN, we have 10 years to prevent a 1.5C rise above pre-industrial temperature but, whatever happens, we will suffer.\nPandemics and the climate crisis may go hand in hand, too: research suggests that changing weather patterns may drive species to higher altitudes, potentially putting them in contact with diseases for which they have little immunity. \u201cIt\u2019s strange when people see the climate crisis as being in the future, compared to coronavirus, which we\u2019re facing now,\u201d says Friends of the Earth\u2019s co-executive director, Miriam Turner. \u201cIt might be something that feels far away when sitting in an office in central London, but the emergency footing of the climate crisis is being felt by hundreds of millions already.\u201d\nImagine, then, that we felt the same sense of emergency about the climate crisis as we do about coronavirus. What action would we take? As the New Economic Foundation\u2019s Alfie Stirling points out, a strict demarcation between the two crises in unwise. After all, coronavirus may trigger a global slowdown: the economic measures in response to this should be linked to solving the climate crisis. \u201cWhat tends to happen in a recession is policy-makers panic about what the low-lying fruits are; it\u2019s all supply chains and sticking plasters,\u201d he tells me. During the 2008 crash, for example, there was an immediate cut in VAT and interest rates, but investment spending wasn\u2019t hiked fast enough, and was then slashed in the name of austerity. According to NEF research, if the coalition government had funded additional zero-carbon infrastructure, it would not only have boosted the economy but could have reduced residential emissions by 30%. This time round, there\u2019s little room to cut already low interest rates or boost quantitative easing; green fiscal policy must be the priority.\nWhat would be mentioned in that solemn prime ministerial speech on the steps of No 10, broadcast live across TV networks? All homes and businesses would be insulated, creating jobs, cutting fuel poverty and reducing emissions. Electric car charging points would be installed across the country. Britain currently lacks the skills to transform the nation\u2019s infrastructure, for example replacing fuel pumps, says Stirling: an emergency training programme to train the workforce would be announced. \nA frequent flyer levy for regular, overwhelmingly affluent air passengers would be introduced. As Turner says, all government policies will now be seen through the prism of coronavirus. A similar climate lens should be applied, and permanently.\nThis would only be the start. Friends of the Earth calls for free bus travel for the under-30s, combined with urgent investment in the bus network. Renewable energy would be doubled, again producing new jobs, clean energy, and reducing deadly air pollution. The government would end all investments of taxpayers\u2019 money in fossil fuel infrastructure and launch a new tree-planting programme to double the size of forests in Britain, one of Europe\u2019s least densely forested nations.\nThere is a key difference between coronavirus and climate crisis, of course, and it is shame. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know coronavirus was coming,\u201d says Stirling. \u201cWe\u2019ve known the climate crisis was on the cards for 30 or 40 years.\u201d And yet \u2013 despite being inadequately prepared because of an underfunded, under-resourced NHS \u2013 the government can swiftly announce an emergency pandemic plan.\nCoronavirus poses many challenges and threats, but few opportunities. A judicious response to global heating would provide affordable transport, well-insulated homes, skilled green jobs and clean air. Urgent action to prevent a pandemic is of course necessary and pressing. But the climate crisis represents a far graver and deadlier existential threat, and yet the same sense of urgency is absent.

But for now, let\u2019s play the game and turn to the IPCC.\n\nIn 2012 the IPCC published a\u00a0Special Report on Extreme Weather (SREX), gathering up the available knowledge on storms, droughts, etc, and their possible connection to climate change generally and carbon dioxide emissions specifically.\nContrary to McCarthy\u2019s claim, the SREX singled out the U.S. as a\u00a0region where \u201cdroughts have become less frequent, less intense or shorter.\u201d Worldwide there is only \u201climited to medium\u201d regional evidence regarding changes in floods because the records are sparse and the effects are confounded with changes in land use and engineering. \u201cFurthermore,\u201d they said, \u201cthere is low agreement in this evidence, and thus overall low confidence at the global scale regarding even the sign of these changes.\u201d\nDoes this sound like the level of confidence associated with the link between smoking and cancer?\nOverall the IPCC\u2019s attribution of a\u00a0causal link between extreme weather and carbon dioxide emissions was the limpest possible: \u201cThere is evidence that some extremes have changed as a\u00a0result of anthropogenic influences, including increases in atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases.\u201d But, they went on, there is only low confidence in attribution of tropical cyclone activity to anthropogenic influences, and \u201cAttribution of single extreme events to anthropogenic climate change is challenging\u201d \u2014 UN speak for \u201cwe\u2019d go further if we could but even we can\u2019t torque the evidence that far.\u201d\nThey also made it clear that economic vulnerability to weather is a\u00a0function of a\u00a0nation\u2019s wealth, adding \u201cIncreasing exposure of people and economic assets has been the major cause of long\u2010\u200bterm increases in economic losses from weather\u2010 and climate\u2010\u200brelated disasters (high confidence). Long\u2010\u200bterm trends in economic disaster losses adjusted for wealth and population increases have not been attributed to climate change, but a\u00a0role for climate change has not been excluded.\u201d\nDo doctors say \u201ctrends in lung cancer have not been attributed to cigarette smoking, but a\u00a0role for tobacco has not been excluded\u201d? Of course not. McCarthy\u2019s invocation of scientific certainty and prohibition on further debate was mere demagoguery.\nAfter boasting about the extensive research and consultation that went into the rule, McCarthy then said that it will reduce household utility costs, a\u00a0prediction based on engineering studies behind the energy efficiency rules in the Clean Power Plan. But do these programs really save households money?\nA growing body of economic analysis over the years has indicated that the models overstate the potential savings from energy efficiency programs. New evidence from a\u00a0large\u2010\u200bscale randomized field experiment has confirmed this. Conducted by a\u00a0team of economists from Berkeley and MIT, the study tracked more than 30,000 households in the federal Weatherization Assistance Program. Participants in the program went through household energy audits using a\u00a0government\u2010\u200bapproved engineering model to estimate the savings from undertaking a\u00a0fully subsidized efficiency upgrade.\nBy comparing before\u2010 and after\u2010\u200bdata, and comparing against households that did not undergo weatherization, the authors showed that the engineering models were way off, exaggerating the energy savings 2.5\u2011fold, with the result that the renovations cost twice the value of the subsequent energy savings. Even taking account of social and environmental benefits the rate of return on the program was about \u20119.5 percent annually, in other words the costs greatly exceeded the benefits.\nThe authors also found that the implicit cost of carbon dioxide emission reductions in the program were about $330 per tonne, roughly ten times the administration\u2019s own estimate of the Social Cost of Carbon. In other words, taking the administration\u2019s science and economics at face value, a\u00a0major component of their climate plan costs $330 per tonne for emission cuts they themselves value at $38 per tonne.\nMcCarthy told her audience not to question her science and to respect the research behind their climate policy. If you doubt her analysis, you will definitely find the policy plan misguided. The problem is that, even if you accept her science and economics, it\u2019s still misguided.", "label": 1}}
